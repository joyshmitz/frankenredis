> **FrankenRedis is a memory-safe, clean-room Rust reimplementation of Redis 7.2.4 with strict drop-in protocol parity, a first-class strict/hardened compatibility split, a Sentinel state machine, a 5,076-case bespoke differential conformance corpus, pinned live Redis 7.2.4 oracle gates, and direct execution of Redis 7.2.4's own unmodified Tcl test suite against FrankenRedis.**

---

## TL;DR

### The problem

Redis is the de facto in-memory data store, but the canonical implementation is ~250k lines of C. That has real consequences:

- **Memory-unsafety risk surface.** Buffer overruns, use-after-free, signed-overflow UB, and parser quirks have produced real Redis CVEs over the years. A Rust reimplementation eliminates the entire category at compile time.
- **No first-class strict-vs-hardened compatibility split.** Stock Redis has one behavior. There is no way to say "be byte-exact with upstream" in one mode and "fail closed on anything ambiguous, log the decision, never bounded-defend silently" in the other.
- **Audit and replay opacity.** Stock Redis does not emit a structured, deterministic ledger of every threat-event, recovery, or policy override; reconstructing what happened after an incident is detective work.
- **No reusable internal model.** You cannot embed Redis's command engine, replication state machine, or RDB codec into a Rust project without bringing the whole server.

### The solution

FrankenRedis ships a Rust workspace whose crates each own one job (`fr-protocol`, `fr-command`, `fr-store`, `fr-persist`, `fr-repl`, `fr-sentinel`, `fr-runtime`, …) and a `frankenredis` binary that speaks RESP2/3 on the wire. Every component is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. Every command goes through a strict-vs-hardened policy gate. Every divergence from vendored Redis 7.2.4 is either closed by a code change or filed as a tracked parity bead, with evidence from bespoke differential fixtures, live Redis-oracle probes, interoperability gates, and Redis's own upstream Tcl tests.

### Why use FrankenRedis?

| You want… | FrankenRedis gives you |
|---|---|
| **A memory-safe Redis** | `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in 11 of 15 crates (parser, data engine, persistence, replication, sentinel, event loop, config, expire, server, conformance, bench). The `unsafe` that remains is fenced into four places with audited reasons: `fr-simd` (CPU-feature-gated SIMD kernels for BITCOUNT/BITOP/HyperLogLog/CRC64), `fr-uring` (the io_uring submission boundary, compiled only with the `io-uring-writes` feature), `fr-command` (a `libc` locale handle for `SORT ALPHA` collation), and `fr-runtime` (`libc::waitpid` for BGSAVE/BGREWRITEAOF children) |
| **Drop-in protocol parity with Redis 7.2.4** | Every one of Redis 7.2.4's 242 top-level commands (241 visible outside sentinel mode) and 150 subcommands is recognized and implemented, a 5,076-case bespoke differential corpus, pinned Redis 7.2.4 live-oracle gates, and Redis 7.2.4's own unmodified Tcl tests executed against FrankenRedis. The Redis 7.4 hash-field TTL commands (`HEXPIRE`/`HTTL`/`HPERSIST`) exist in the tree but are deliberately not exposed, for 7.2.4 parity |
| **Upstream fidelity evidence, not just home-grown tests** | A fast hard gate runs 72 selected upstream Redis 7.2.4 Tcl assertions; a dedicated full-suite workflow runs every default unit returned by Redis 7.2.4 `runtest --list-tests` in external-server mode, preserving upstream's own `external:skip` annotations and emitting machine-readable evidence |
| **A compatibility/security policy split** | `Mode::Strict` (byte-exact replies, no defensive repairs) vs `Mode::Hardened` (preserves contract, adds fail-closed guards for malformed/adversarial input) |
| **A Sentinel state machine** | The `fr-sentinel` crate implements `__sentinel__:hello` discovery, quorum-based S_DOWN/O_DOWN, epoch leader election, and a 7-state failover machine, matching the conceptual model of Redis Sentinel. Driven live by `frankenredis --sentinel`: the peer vote exchange, leader election, promotion and follower convergence are exercised end to end by the fr-server TCP tests, including a three-sentinel quorum-2 failover. |
| **Live differential parity testing** | The `fr-conformance` harness runs fixtures against FrankenRedis and a pinned Redis 7.2.4 oracle and diffs replies byte-for-byte across 43 fixture families covering every command domain |
| **Reproducible benchmarks and a regression gate** | `fr-bench` + checked-in baseline JSON under `baselines/` + `scripts/benchmark_gate.sh` with tunable p99/throughput thresholds |
| **A clean architectural model to read or embed** | 15 small focused crates with explicit boundaries; the data engine, RESP codec, RDB codec, replication FSM, and Lua evaluator are each usable independently |

## See it in action

Start the server and talk to it with stock `redis-cli`:

```bash
# Terminal A — start FrankenRedis on the standard port
$ ./target/release/frankenredis --port 6379
[fr-server] listening on 127.0.0.1:6379 (mode=strict)

# Terminal B — drive it with the standard Redis client
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> SET hello world
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> GET hello
"world"
127.0.0.1:6379> XADD events '*' kind login user 42
"1778889600123-0"
127.0.0.1:6379> XLEN events
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> EVAL "local v = redis.call('INCR', KEYS[1]); return v * tonumber(ARGV[1])" 1 counter 7
(integer) 7
127.0.0.1:6379> OBJECT ENCODING counter
"int"
127.0.0.1:6379> CLIENT INFO
id=3 addr=127.0.0.1:51294 laddr=127.0.0.1:6379 fd=12 name= age=42 idle=0 flags=N db=0 sub=0 psub=0 ssub=0 multi=-1 …
```

Wire up replication and persistence with the same flags Redis uses:

```bash
# Primary on 6379, replica on 6380, both AOF-enabled
$ ./target/release/frankenredis --port 6379 --aof ./primary.aof --rdb ./primary.rdb
$ ./target/release/frankenredis --port 6380 --aof ./replica.aof --rdb ./replica.rdb \
    --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379
```

The replica issues `PSYNC` / `FULLRESYNC` against the primary, streams the RDB snapshot, replays the backlog, and acknowledges offsets via `REPLCONF ACK`, exactly like Redis does. You can also point a vendored `redis-server` at FrankenRedis (or vice versa) and they will replicate to each other.

## What's implemented today

| Area | State | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Commands** | **All 242 Redis 7.2.4 top-level commands and 150 subcommands recognized and implemented.** A handful of admin arms accept-and-OK where a single node has nothing to do (`CLUSTER MEET`/`SAVECONFIG`/`SETSLOT`, `SCRIPT DEBUG`, ten `DEBUG` subcommands); each is documented in code. The Redis 7.4 hash-field TTL commands are compiled but not exposed. | All command families: strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, geo, hyperloglog, bitmap, pub/sub, scripting (EVAL/FCALL), server, cluster (single-node), connection, ACL, transactions, debug, function, memory, slowlog, latency, monitor. |
| **Wire protocol** | RESP2 native; RESP3 inbound parsing with downconversion. | `fr-protocol` enforces upstream `max_bulk_len = 512 MiB`, `max_array_len = 1M`, `max_recursion_depth = 128`, CRLF-injection sanitization on error/string bodies. RESP3 `Map`/`Set` emitted on the reply side when the client negotiates `protocol_version=3` (`HELLO 3`) for `CONFIG GET`, `HGETALL`, `XINFO STREAM/GROUPS/CONSUMERS`. |
| **Persistence** | AOF + RDB v11, both round-trip-tested. | Manifest-based multi-part AOF with `everysec`/`always`/`no` fsync; AOF replay with bounded tail-repair policies. RDB v11 with LZF compression on strings >20 B, CRC64 footer, standalone listpack decoder for upstream macro-node entries, and decoder coverage for upstream compact type tags `RDB_TYPE_SET_INTSET` (11), `RDB_TYPE_HASH_LISTPACK` (16), `RDB_TYPE_ZSET_LISTPACK` (17), `RDB_TYPE_LIST_QUICKLIST_2` (18), `RDB_TYPE_STREAM_LISTPACKS_2` (19), `RDB_TYPE_SET_LISTPACK` (20), and `RDB_TYPE_STREAM_LISTPACKS_3` (21). `FUNCTION DUMP`/`RESTORE` wrapped in an upstream version + CRC64 envelope so functions round-trip through vendored servers. |
| **Replication** | TCP end-to-end, both directions. | `--replicaof` and `REPLICAOF`/`SLAVEOF` from clients; `AUTH`/`REPLCONF`/`PSYNC` handshake; `FULLRESYNC` snapshot stream; `CONTINUE` backlog replay; `REPLCONF ACK` offset accounting; replica-of-replica chaining; `min-replicas-to-write` / `min-replicas-max-lag` write admission; reconnect with backoff. Integration tests prove legacy → FrankenRedis, password-protected legacy → FrankenRedis, and FrankenRedis → replica → downstream replica. |
| **Sentinel** | `--sentinel` mode with monitoring, quorum voting and automatic failover. | `__sentinel__:hello` pub/sub discovery, PING/INFO probing of the master and every discovered replica, subjective-down → objective-down, and the 7-state failover machine (`SelectSlave` → `SendSlaveofNoone` → `WaitPromotion` → `ReconfSlaves` → `UpdateConfig`) driven from the server loop: `SENTINEL FAILOVER` and automatic failover after O_DOWN promote the best replica with `SLAVEOF NO ONE`, point the other replicas at it, and demote a former master when it returns. Sentinels ask each other `SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR` over persistent non-blocking links, so a quorum above 1 reaches O_DOWN on peer answers, exactly one leader wins the epoch (upstream's join-the-leader tie-break), and the followers adopt the promoted replica from the leader's hello; a three-sentinel quorum-2 TCP test kills the primary and requires one failover with one agreed config epoch. Full `SENTINEL` command surface. Still open: sentinel config files (`sentinel monitor ...` directives) and notification/reconfig scripts. |
| **Lua scripting** | Custom Lua 5.1 evaluator (no FFI, no embedded VM). | EVAL/EVALSHA/EVAL_RO/EVALSHA_RO + FCALL/FCALL_RO + FUNCTION LOAD/DUMP/RESTORE/STATS/DELETE; `redis.call`/`pcall`/`status_reply`/`error_reply`/`sha1hex`/`log`/`replicate_commands`/`set_repl`/`setresp`/`acl_check_cmd`/`breakpoint`/`debug` plus `redis.REPL_*` and `redis.LOG_*` constants; full pattern matcher (`%b` balanced, `%f[set]` frontier, `%1`–`%9` back-references); script-relevant metamethods (`__index`/`__newindex`/`__call`/`__concat`/`__add` family/`__eq`/`__lt`/`__le`/`__tostring`/`__unm`/`__metatable`; `__mode`/`__len`/`__gc` not exposed); LuaJIT-compatible `bit` library; `cjson.encode`/`decode` with upstream `%.14g` formatting; KEYS/ARGV; closures with lexical-scope upvalue capture; coroutines. |
| **ACL** | Full lifecycle. | `SETUSER`/`GETUSER`/`DELUSER`/`LIST`/`USERS`/`WHOAMI`/`CAT`/`GENPASS`/`LOG`/`SAVE`/`LOAD`/`DRYRUN`/`HELP`; per-command `+cmd`/`-cmd`, per-category `+@cat`/`-@cat`, `allcommands`/`nocommands`/`allkeys`/`allchannels`/`reset`, key pattern `~pattern`, channel pattern `&pattern`; deny-first precedence enforced at dispatch. |
| **Pub/Sub** | Cross-client delivery. | SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE/PSUBSCRIBE/PUNSUBSCRIBE/PUBLISH/PUBSUB plus shard variants SSUBSCRIBE/SUNSUBSCRIBE/SPUBLISH; subscription-mode command restriction; deterministic unsubscribe-all ordering. Keyspace notifications via `CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events`. |
| **Blocking ops** | Real socket-level blocking. | BLPOP/BRPOP/BLMOVE/BLMPOP/BRPOPLPUSH/BZPOPMIN/BZPOPMAX/BZMPOP/XREAD BLOCK/XREADGROUP BLOCK/WAIT/WAITAOF/CLIENT PAUSE with deadline tracking and session swap-out in the mio loop. |
| **Conformance** | Bespoke differential + upstream Redis tests. | 5,076 fixture cases across 46 fixture files (36 `core_*` families plus packet-journey, replay and protocol corpora); a pinned Redis 7.2.4 live-oracle parity matrix; a 72-assertion upstream Tcl hard gate; and a dedicated workflow that runs every default Redis 7.2.4 `runtest` unit against FrankenRedis in external-server mode and records pass/skip/ignore/error counts plus exact unit completion. |
| **Fuzzing** | 33 `cargo-fuzz` targets. | Parser (RESP, inline), command parse, RDB encode/decode/structured, AOF decoder/manifest, store bitops/HLL/scan/stream-groups, runtime execute_bytes/sequence/eventloop validators, Lua eval, function restore, PSYNC reply, MIGRATE/DUMP, client tracking, keyspace events, glob match, config file, TLS config, ACL rules, sentinel parsers. |
| **Benchmarks** | Checked-in baselines + regression gate. | `crates/fr-bench` issues 8 standard workloads (SET/GET/INCR/LPUSH/LPOP/HSET/HGET/MIXED), records HdrHistogram p50/p95/p99/p999, normalizes to `frankenredis_baseline/v1` JSON, and `scripts/benchmark_gate.sh` compares candidate runs against the checked-in baselines with tunable thresholds. |

## Performance
Measured against vendored Redis 7.2.4 running side-by-side in the same invocation, on the same host.
Vendored `redis-benchmark` drives both engines, so neither side gets a home-field client. Each server
is pinned to its own verified-idle core with the client on a third, arm order alternates every round,
the statistic is the median of per-round ratios, and a second FrankenRedis process is measured in the
same invocation as an A/A null control. Both binaries are identified by ELF SHA-256 in the artifact.
Harness: `scripts/syscall_decomposition.sh`.

| Workload | Pipeline | ops/s FR ÷ Redis 7.2.4 | user instructions/op | CPU ns/op | A/A null (ops/s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SET key val EX 100` | 16 | **1.463** | 0.408 | 0.685 | 0.992 |
| SET                  | 16 | **1.333** | 0.360 | 0.751 | 0.988 |
| INCR                 | 16 | **1.255** | 0.360 | 0.801 | 0.999 |
| GET                  | 16 | **1.029** | 0.428 | 0.932 | 0.979 |
| GET                  | 1  | 0.998 | 0.787 | **0.970** | 0.990 |
| INCR                 | 1  | 0.991 | **0.654** | **0.969** | 0.990 |
| SET                  | 1  | 0.989 | **0.634** | **0.967** | 0.986 |
| `SET key val EX 100` | 1  | 0.986 | **0.614** | **0.969** | 0.989 |

At `pipeline=16` FrankenRedis leads Redis 7.2.4 on every workload measured. Across both depths it
executes **1.3-2.8x fewer user-mode instructions per operation** and uses less CPU per operation on
all eight measurements.

Two things to know about reading the unpipelined rows:

- **The `ops/s` column is a client ceiling, not a server limit.** All arms sit at ~74-75k ops/s
  because a single-core `redis-benchmark` saturates there while the server still has headroom
  (measured: client 100.1% of a core, server 83.1%). `CPU ns/op` is the client-independent statement.
- **At `pipeline=1` roughly 90% of server cycles are kernel** on this host - loopback TCP plus its
  `auditd`/`nftables`/`conntrack` configuration - and both engines pay ~28,000 kernel instructions
  per operation, within 1% of each other. A userland win therefore moves unpipelined `ops/s` very
  little.

Current stream-dispatch measurements use the same live-incumbent contract:

| Workload | ops/s FR ÷ Redis 7.2.4 | bootstrap 95% median CI | A/A null median |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `XADD key MAXLEN ~ 1000 * field value` | **1.668x** | **[1.651, 1.770]** | 1.005 |
| `XADD key MAXLEN ~ 1000 LIMIT 100 * field value` | **1.733x** | **[1.727, 1.755]** | 0.992 |

The checked-in `baselines/*.json` are a separate, older capture used by `scripts/benchmark_gate.sh`
as a regression reference; they are not the numbers above. Build with `--profile release-perf` for
benchmarking.

**Where FrankenRedis is behind Redis 7.2.4.** The table above is the pipelined command path; it is not
the whole story, and the repository's own evidence documents (`docs/RELEASE_READINESS_SCORECARD.md`,
`docs/perf_domination_scorecard.md`, `docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md`) record these measured losses:

| Surface | FrankenRedis ÷ Redis 7.2.4 | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| Resident memory, 1M short string keys (fresh process, kernel VmRSS delta) | 1.17x | 2026-09-02 probe on this host |
| Resident memory, 100k ten-field hashes / 20k fifty-member zsets / 20k fifty-member sets / small streams | 2.3x–2.9x | 2026-09-02 probe; keyspace-dict work is bead `uhthd`, small-collection layout has no bead yet |
| `SET` with 64 KB–256 KB values | 0.12x–0.42x | RELEASE_READINESS_SCORECARD (safe-Rust zero-fill framing tax) |
| Collection `RESTORE` decode | 0.61x | NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE 2026-08-16, with CI and A/A null |
| `FCALL` dispatch (instructions per op) | ~1.33x more | perf_negative_evidence_ledger, closed as dispatch layering |

The scorecards' ratcheted matrix reads 7 wins / 6 losses / 2 neutral on its stable cells with a
0.952x geometric mean and a ratchet status of FAIL. A controlled quiet-host re-baseline (bead
`vibu6`) would be required before the pipelined table is quoted as a release number; that bead
is currently **deferred**, so until it is un-defered the pipelined table should be read as a
contention-sandbox measurement, not a release claim.

To reproduce locally:

```bash
# Build, run both servers, capture normalized baseline JSON under baselines/
./scripts/record_baselines.sh

# Compare a candidate run against the checked-in baselines
FR_BENCH_THROUGHPUT_DROP_PCT=10 FR_BENCH_P99_REGRESSION_PCT=20 \
  ./scripts/benchmark_gate.sh
```

## Design philosophy

### 1. Deterministic Latency Replication Core (DLRC)

Strict command semantics, tail-aware scheduling, and recoverable persistence pipelines are treated as core identity constraints, not best-effort niceties. What is enforced today is the single-threaded, arrival-order execution model and the admission validators that `fr-eventloop` supplies to the server loop on every read and accept (query-buffer limit, `maxclients`). `fr-eventloop` also models the loop as five named phases (`BeforeSleep` → `Poll` → `FileDispatch` → `TimeDispatch` → `AfterSleep`) with per-phase tick budgets; that model is a design and a validator library, and the shipping mio loop does not execute it (see "Event loop discipline" below for exactly what is live).

### 2. Strict vs Hardened mode split

`fr-config` exposes two operating modes, set with `--mode strict` or `--mode hardened`:

| Mode | Posture | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Strict** | Maximizes observable compatibility with vendored Redis. No behavior-altering repairs. If the input is ambiguous, reproduce the upstream behavior, including upstream quirks. | Production drop-in replacement, anywhere a downstream client depends on byte-exact replies. |
| **Hardened** | Preserves the API contract but adds bounded defensive recovery for malformed inputs and hostile edge cases. Threat events are recorded; the decision (`FailClosed`, `BoundedDefense`, `RejectNonAllowlisted`) is logged with an input digest. | Internet-facing deployments, multi-tenant gateways, anywhere you'd rather reject than guess. |

The mode is enforced at the `Runtime::execute_frame` boundary, not as a sprinkling of `if` statements. Adding a new command means filing it under one of the eight threat classes in `fr-config::ThreatClass` (ParserAbuse, VersionSkew, ResourceExhaustion, …) and declaring the decision action for each class.

### 3. Differential conformance against the real oracle

There is one behavioral target: Redis 7.2.4. FrankenRedis checks it through several independent evidence classes instead of trusting one home-grown suite. The bespoke `fr-conformance` corpus runs the same fixtures against FrankenRedis and a pinned Redis 7.2.4 oracle and diffs the observable replies. Targeted Python gates probe interop, persistence, replication, RESP behavior, scripting, fuzzed command sequences, and other surfaces. On top of that, FrankenRedis now runs **Redis 7.2.4's own unmodified Tcl tests** through upstream's native external-server mode.

The upstream lane is intentionally separate from the bespoke corpus. `scripts/upstream_redis_tcl_fidelity.py` is a fast hard gate over selected assertions, while `scripts/upstream_redis_tcl_full.py` enumerates every default unit from Redis 7.2.4 `runtest --list-tests`, requires every unit to complete exactly once, preserves upstream `external:skip` decisions, rejects vacuous/partial runs, and emits structured evidence. This gives us an answer to two different questions: “does our differential model think we match?” and “what does Redis's own test suite say when pointed at FrankenRedis?”

A repeating "probe sweep" workflow uses adversarial command sequences to find new divergences, files each one as a beads issue, and closes them one at a time. This pattern is visible across hundreds of commits tagged `(frankenredis-<slug>)`.

### 4. Memory safety as a structural property, not a slogan

`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is set in 11 of 15 crates (the parser, data engine, persistence, replication, sentinel, event loop, config, expire, server, conformance, bench). The other four hold every `unsafe` site in the workspace, each fenced with a stated reason: `fr-simd` (46 sites) is the SIMD kernel crate, where every `unsafe fn` is a `#[target_feature]` kernel for BITCOUNT, BITPOS, BITOP, HyperLogLog merging and the RDB CRC64, called only after `is_x86_feature_detected!` and shadowed by a scalar reference implementation; `fr-uring` (5 sites) is the io_uring submission boundary, compiled only with the `io-uring-writes` feature and off by default; `fr-command` (7 sites, `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`) holds a `libc` locale handle so `SORT ALPHA` collates the way glibc does; and `fr-runtime` (3 sites, `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`) wraps `libc::waitpid` to reap `BGSAVE` and `BGREWRITEAOF` child processes. The fork-and-wait pattern is unavoidable for those subsystems on Unix; everything else stays in safe Rust. Common dangerous helpers (`libc::getrusage`, `libc::clock_gettime`, raw FFI) are explicitly avoided. The custom Lua evaluator is written in safe Rust against a `LuaValue` enum, with no embedded C VM.

### 5. Audit-first, repair-second

When the hardened mode detects something unusual (an oversized bulk, an unknown RESP3 type, a malformed AOF tail), it emits a deterministic threat-event ledger entry with a SHA256 input digest, a class, a decision, and a timestamp. That ledger is what the operator sees in postmortem, not just "the server kept running."

### 6. Profile-guided optimization with isomorphism proofs

Performance work is gated on showing that observable behavior didn't change. Each round produces an `ISOMORPHISM_PROOF_*.md` artifact next to before/after flamegraphs and `strace` syscall profiles under `artifacts/optimization/`.

```

The whole path is single-threaded, which is a deliberate choice for determinism. The mio loop is `non-blocking I/O + one CPU core`, and that's where the deterministic-latency contract is actually enforced.

## Implementation deep-dives

Opt-in detail for engineers who want to understand the internals (algorithms, data layouts, invariants) rather than just operate the server.

### Data engine internals (`fr-store`)

Every key in FrankenRedis is a `Vec<u8>` mapping to an `Entry`:

```rust
struct Entry {
    value: Value,
    expires_at_ms: Option<u64>,
    last_access_ms: u64,         // OBJECT IDLETIME / LRU eviction
    lfu_freq: u8,                // OBJECT FREQ; LFU eviction
    lfu_last_touch_min: u64,     // logarithmic LFU decay
    modification_count: u64,     // WATCH ABA detection
    // One-way encoding-promotion sticky flags (mirror upstream
    // semantics — once promoted, never demoted).
    force_raw_encoding: bool,
    force_string_encoding: bool,
    force_set_listpack_encoding: bool,
    force_set_hashtable_encoding: bool,
    force_hash_hashtable_encoding: bool,
    force_zset_skiplist_encoding: bool,
}

enum Value {
    String(Vec<u8>),
    Hash(BTreeMap<Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>>),
    List(VecDeque<Vec<u8>>),
    Set(BTreeSet<Vec<u8>>),
    SortedSet(SortedSet),                  // dual-indexed
    Stream(StreamEntries),                 // BTreeMap<(ms, seq), Vec<(field, value)>>
}
```

**Why dual-index sorted sets?** Redis uses a hash table (member → score) and a skiplist (ordered by score, then member). FrankenRedis's `SortedSet` keeps the same two-sided contract (`O(1)` ZSCORE / ZADD lookup, `O(log n)` range scans) but realizes the ordered side with a `BTreeMap<ScoreMember, ()>` instead of a hand-rolled skiplist:

```rust
pub struct SortedSet {
    dict:    HashMap<Vec<u8>, f64>,           // member → score
    ordered: BTreeMap<ScoreMember, ()>,       // (score, member) → ()
}
```

`ScoreMember` wraps `(f64, MemberPart)` where `MemberPart` is a small enum `{ Min, Actual(Vec<u8>), Max }`. The `Min` and `Max` sentinels exist so range queries can construct `(score, MemberPart::Min)` and `(score, MemberPart::Max)` keys that bracket any real member at that score — important for BYLEX range queries. Ordering uses `f64::total_cmp` for the score (handles NaN, -0 vs +0, +∞/-∞) with the lexicographic member as tie-breaker. Range queries by score (`ZRANGEBYSCORE`), by lex (`ZRANGEBYLEX`), and by rank (`ZRANGE 0 -1`) all become standard `BTreeMap::range` traversals. The result is the same algorithmic complexity as upstream with substantially less code.

**Encoding promotion is sticky.** Real Redis promotes encodings one-way: an `intset` that gets a non-integer member promotes to `listpack`, and once promoted it never demotes even if the offending member is removed. FrankenRedis enforces the same sticky contract via per-`Entry` boolean flags. The promotion paths are:

| Type | Initial | First promotion | Second promotion |
|---|---|---|---|
| String | `int` or `embstr` (≤44 B) | `raw` (any in-place mutation) | — |
| Hash | inline `BTreeMap` (treated as `listpack` by `OBJECT ENCODING`) | `hashtable` (exceeds `hash-max-listpack-{entries,value}`) | — |
| List | `VecDeque` (treated as `listpack`/`quicklist` by `OBJECT ENCODING`) | `quicklist` (exceeds `list-max-listpack-size`) | — |
| Set | `intset` (all-integer members) | `listpack` (first non-integer) | `hashtable` (exceeds `set-max-listpack-{entries,value}`) |
| SortedSet | `listpack` (small + short values) | `skiplist` (exceeds `zset-max-listpack-{entries,value}`) | — |

`OBJECT ENCODING` reports the post-promotion name, which matters because real-world clients sometimes branch on it (e.g., to know whether a `HGETALL` is `O(n)` or `O(1)` in the hash size).

**SCAN cursors are positional, not bit-reversed.** Real Redis uses a clever reverse-binary cursor that survives hash-table rehashing without missing or duplicating keys. FrankenRedis's `HashMap` doesn't have Redis's two-table rehash, so it can get away with a simpler positional cursor: `next_cursor = pos`, returning `0` on completion. Redis explicitly documents SCAN cursors as opaque to clients, so this is allowed; `HSCAN`/`SSCAN`/`ZSCAN` short-circuit small-encoding values (return everything with cursor = 0) just like upstream does.

**Hash field TTL** uses `hash_field_expires: BTreeMap<(key, field), expires_at_ms>` plus per-key reap counters, with RDB round-trips through `RDB_TYPE_HASH_WITH_TTLS` (tag 100). The Redis 7.4 `HEXPIRE`, `HTTL`, and `HPERSIST` commands ship behind a boot-only opt-in: start with `--enable-hash-field-ttl yes` (or the `enable-hash-field-ttl` config directive) to register them on the wire. The default is `no`, which preserves Redis 7.2.4 parity — the three answer unknown-command and are absent from `COMMAND`/`ACL CAT` introspection, pinned by tests in both postures. The storage keeps per-field TTLs so that a 7.4-produced RDB round-trips either way, and elapsed fields are reaped on read.

**LFU is the logarithmic counter from upstream** with `LFU_INIT_VAL = 5` (newly-created objects start at 5 so they aren't immediate eviction candidates) and `lfu-log-factor = 10` controlling counter growth speed; decay is applied via `lfu_last_touch_min` so the counter doesn't grow without bound during long-running cache sessions.

### Lua scripting internals (`fr-command::lua_eval`)

The Lua evaluator is **a clean-room Lua 5.1 interpreter written in safe Rust**: no `mlua`, no `rlua`, no embedded C Lua VM. The entire script runs against this value enum:

```rust
pub enum LuaValue {
    Nil,
    Bool(bool),
    Number(f64),
    Str(Vec<u8>),
    Table(LuaTable),
    Function(LuaFunc),
    RustFunction(String),     // name of a built-in
    Coroutine(LuaCoroutine),
    WrappedCoroutine(LuaCoroutine),
}

pub struct LuaTableInner {
    pub array: Vec<LuaValue>,                       // 1..#t sequence part
    pub string_hash: HashMap<Vec<u8>, LuaValue>,    // string-key fast path
    pub other_hash: Vec<(LuaValue, LuaValue)>,      // boolean/number/table keys
    pub other_keys: HashSet<LuaHashKey>,            // O(1) existence for non-string keys
    pub metatable: Option<LuaTable>,
}
```

A few design notes that matter when porting scripts:

- **Tables have three storage compartments.** The array part for `1..#t`, a string-hash for the overwhelmingly common case of `t.foo`, and a generic kv vector for boolean/number/table keys (with a `HashSet` index to keep existence checks `O(1)`). This is the same shape Lua 5.1 uses internally and is what `pairs`/`ipairs`/`next` walk.
- **Function values are legal table keys.** This is Lua-spec-compliant (a recently closed parity bead).
- **Metamethods that matter for Redis scripts are all implemented.** `__index`/`__newindex` (function or table), `__call`, `__concat`, the arithmetic family (`__add`/`__sub`/`__mul`/`__div`/`__mod`/`__pow`/`__unm`), `__eq`/`__lt`/`__le`, `__tostring`, and `__metatable` protection all match vendored Redis Lua 5.1 semantics including the dispatch ordering between the left and right operands. Lua 5.1 metamethods not exposed today (because Redis scripts essentially never use them under the upstream lua_time_limit budget): `__mode` (weak tables), `__len`, `__gc`.
- **The pattern matcher is full Lua 5.1.** All character classes, all quantifiers (`*`/`+`/`-`/`?`), anchors, captures, and sets, plus the trickier `%b()` balanced match, `%f[set]` frontier, and `%1`–`%9` back-references. The same engine drives `string.match`, `string.gmatch`, `string.gsub`, and `string.find`. (`gmatch` iterators are callable outside `for-in` loops, which matters when scripts pass them as closures.)
- **`cjson` is the bundled upstream encoder/decoder.** `cjson.encode` formats numbers with `%.14g` (the upstream printf format) and escapes `/` exactly the way Redis does. `cjson.decode` is currently permissive about trailing commas and non-string keys; full strict-mode rejection is tracked as a parity bead.
- **The `redis.*` namespace** carries `redis.call`, `redis.pcall`, `redis.error_reply`, `redis.status_reply`, `redis.sha1hex`, `redis.log`, `redis.replicate_commands`, `redis.set_repl`, `redis.setresp`, `redis.acl_check_cmd`, `redis.breakpoint`, `redis.debug`, plus the `redis.REPL_NONE`/`REPL_AOF`/`REPL_SLAVE`/`REPL_REPLICA`/`REPL_ALL` constants (script-side aliases for the upstream `PROPAGATE_*` C enum) and `redis.LOG_DEBUG`/`LOG_VERBOSE`/`LOG_NOTICE`/`LOG_WARNING` log-level constants. `redis.call` propagates the calling script's context so nested calls keep the same replication / RESP version / ACL identity.
- **Pcall shape is precisely upstream.** When a built-in raises, the message is packaged inside `pcall` exactly the way Redis's vendored Lua does: anonymous template for C-builtin errors, named template for Lua errors, `ERR ` prefix where upstream uses one, callable line tracking for `loadstring` chunks. Most of Phase 11 was iterative closure of this surface, one wording at a time.
- **Coroutines work.** `coroutine.create`/`resume`/`yield`/`wrap` are all live; `WrappedCoroutine` exists so `coroutine.wrap` can return a closure that resumes a hidden coroutine without exposing it.
- **Closures with upvalue capture work.** Lexical scoping is real: `local x = 5; local f = function() return x end` captures `x` by upvalue, not by re-evaluation.
- **Known sandbox gaps:** `cmsgpack`, `struct`, `setfenv`/`getfenv`, and `newproxy` are not exposed. Each is a tracked parity bead.

The evaluator is exercised by:
- A dedicated `fuzz_lua_eval` cargo-fuzz target with checked-in seed corpus.
- 272 `core_scripting` conformance fixtures (the fifth-largest fixture family, behind `core_zset` 324, `core_strings` 307, `core_server` 282, and `core_stream` 273).
- A separate `fuzz_function_restore` target covering `FUNCTION DUMP`/`RESTORE` round-trips through the RDB envelope.

### Event loop discipline: DLRC in practice (`fr-eventloop`)

**What is live and what is a model.** Being precise here matters because an earlier version of this section described the model as if it ran. The `frankenredis` binary's event loop (`crates/fr-server/src/main.rs`) is a hand-written mio poll/dispatch loop. From `fr-eventloop` it executes three things on the hot path: `validate_read_path` on every client read (query-buffer limit), `validate_accept_path` on every accept (`maxclients`), and the active-expire cycle planner (`plan_active_expire_cycle`, through `fr-runtime`). The phase model below, `TickBudget`, `run_tick`, the bootstrap validators, the barrier-order and pending-write validators and the TLS accept rate limiter are a planning and validator library with their own tests; the loop calls `plan_tick(0, 0, …)` only to obtain a poll timeout, because feeding it the real accept and command counts was measured to add a per-iteration cost the server could not afford (bead `zw36c`). Whether to make the loop execute the budgeted plan or to retire the model is an open decision (bead `rc-eventloop-dlrc-claim`).

The model reads as follows. Each tick goes through five named phases in fixed order:

```rust
pub enum EventLoopPhase {
    BeforeSleep,    // active-expire, AOF flush per appendfsync everysec, ...
    Poll,           // epoll_wait / mio Poll::poll with computed timeout
    FileDispatch,   // process readable / writable connection events
    TimeDispatch,   // process timers (blocked-client deadlines, replication ACKs)
    AfterSleep,     // post-poll bookkeeping
}

pub const EVENT_LOOP_PHASE_ORDER: [EventLoopPhase; 5] = [/* the five above */];
```

A `TickBudget` carries `max_accepts` and `max_commands` per tick so that, in the model, neither a thundering-herd accept storm nor a single hyperactive client can starve the rest of the loop; the phase-trace replay validators check a recorded trace against that model. In the shipping server those budgets are not enforced and no phase trace is recorded; fairness comes from mio's readiness batching and the per-connection read/write buffer limits instead.

Blocking commands (BLPOP/BRPOP/BLMOVE/BLMPOP/BZPOPMIN/BZPOPMAX/BZMPOP/XREAD BLOCK/XREADGROUP BLOCK/WAIT/WAITAOF/CLIENT PAUSE) plug into this discipline via the `BlockedState { op, deadline_ms }` field on each `ClientConnection`. When the source key gets data (or the deadline arrives in `TimeDispatch`), the command is re-dispatched with the fresh state. Nothing actually blocks an OS thread; the whole server stays inside its single mio loop.

### Threat-event ledger format

Every time the hardened-mode policy engine sees something unusual, the runtime calls `Runtime::record_threat_event(...)` with the inputs needed to materialize a deterministic ledger row. The recorded row carries (at minimum):

```
ThreatEvent
├── now_ms              u64                    server wall-clock at decision time

```

Round 1 makes `Store::state_digest`, `input_digest`, and `state_digest_before/after` lazy (gated behind `self.policy.emit_evidence_ledger`) so the success path pays zero digest cost; the eager precomputation that previously ran on every command was discarded by the threat-event ledger 99.99% of the time. Round 2 short-circuits ACL category resolution for users whose `denied_categories` and `allowed_categories` are both empty (the default `+@all` user), skipping a per-command scan of every ACL category against the full command table (~5,500 string-splitting iterations per command today, with 23 categories × ~240 commands). Together they moved single-command throughput from ~1.3% to 79-99% of Redis. See the Phase 9 CHANGELOG entry for the wider recovery story.

The eight threat classes are:

| Class | Examples |
|---|---|
| `ParserAbuse` | RESP framing larger than allowed, recursion bombs, CRLF injection in error bodies |
| `MetadataAmbiguity` | RDB AUX fields disagreeing with payload, AOF tail with mid-record CRLF |
| `VersionSkew` | Inbound RESP3 type that downgrades unsafely, RDB version older than supported |
| `ResourceExhaustion` | Bulk size approaching the per-config ceiling, unbounded SCAN MATCH on huge keyspaces |
| `PersistenceTampering` | RDB CRC64 mismatch, truncated AOF chunk |
| `ReplicationOrderAttack` | Out-of-order replication offset, replica reconnect with mismatched run-id |
| `AuthPolicyConfusion` | ACL deny-allow conflict, deprecated user attempting privileged op |
| `ConfigDowngradeAbuse` | Attempt to widen a protected CONFIG without proper authorization |

Decision actions:

- **`FailClosed`**: reply with an error, log the event, do not mutate state.
- **`BoundedDefense`**: apply a contract-preserving repair (e.g., clamp an oversized bulk to the ceiling), log the event, continue.
- **`RejectNonAllowlisted`**: reply normally if the threat class is in the operator's `HARDENED_ALLOWLIST_DEFAULT`, otherwise treat as FailClosed.

In strict mode every threat class defaults to `FailClosed` with `DriftSeverity::S0`; strict mode never silently defends.

### RDB v11 byte layout, walked

A FrankenRedis RDB file from `BGSAVE` looks like this on the wire (annotated to match vendored byte-for-byte):

```
+----------------------------------------------------+
| "REDIS" (5 bytes)                                  |
| "0011"  (4 bytes — RDB version 11)                 |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| AUX header opcodes (0xFA <key-string> <val-string>)|
|   "redis-ver"   → "7.2.4"   (REDIS_COMPAT_VERSION) |
|   "frankenredis"→ "true"    (origin marker)        |
|   (Other AUX fields like "redis-bits", "ctime",    |
|    "used-mem", "aof-base" are also *accepted* on   |
|    decode when produced by vendored Redis but are  |
|    not emitted by FrankenRedis BGSAVE today.)      |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| For each non-empty database:                       |
|   SELECTDB     (0xFE) <db-index>                   |
|   RESIZEDB     (0xFB) <key-count> <expire-count>   |
|   For each key in this db:                         |
|     [EXPIRETIME_MS (0xFC) <8 bytes little-end>]    | optional
|     <RDB_TYPE_*>  (one byte, see table below)      |
|     <key>         (RDB string-length encoded)      |
|     <value>       (per-type, see below)            |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| EOF (0xFF)                                         |
| CRC64 footer (8 bytes, little-endian, Redis poly)  |
+----------------------------------------------------+
```

Type tags currently understood:

| Tag | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0  | `RDB_TYPE_STRING`           | Raw / embstr / int (encoded via length) |
| 1  | `RDB_TYPE_LIST`             | Legacy linked list |
| 2  | `RDB_TYPE_SET`              | Hash-table set |
| 4  | `RDB_TYPE_HASH`             | Plain hash table |
| 5  | `RDB_TYPE_ZSET_2`           | Sorted set with binary LE double scores |
| 11 | `RDB_TYPE_SET_INTSET`       | Intset (all-integer set) |
| 15 | `RDB_TYPE_STREAM_LISTPACKS`   | Stream — FrankenRedis encoding |
| 16 | `RDB_TYPE_HASH_LISTPACK`    | Hash in listpack form |
| 17 | `RDB_TYPE_ZSET_LISTPACK`    | Sorted set in listpack form |
| 18 | `RDB_TYPE_LIST_QUICKLIST_2` | Quicklist of listpacks |
| 19 | `RDB_TYPE_STREAM_LISTPACKS_2` | Stream — upstream 6.2+ |
| 20 | `RDB_TYPE_SET_LISTPACK`     | Set in listpack form |
| 21 | `RDB_TYPE_STREAM_LISTPACKS_3` | Stream — upstream 7.4+ |
| 100| `RDB_TYPE_HASH_WITH_TTLS`   | Hash with per-field TTLs (Redis 7.4 / fr) |

**LZF compression.** Strings >20 B are LZF-compressed using a pure-Rust port of Marc Lehmann's algorithm. The wire format is the exact compressed-byte layout vendored emits, verified by round-trip fuzzing through both servers (`fuzz_rdb_encode_round_trip` and the live RDB corpus harvester).

**CRC64 footer.** The hash is computed over every byte of the file from the `"REDIS"` magic through the EOF opcode, using the same `CRC64_REDIS_POLY` polynomial vendored uses. A trailing mismatched CRC fails closed in both strict and hardened mode (it's `PersistenceTampering`).

**FUNCTION DUMP envelope.** `FUNCTION DUMP <lib>` returns a payload that begins with the RDB version, contains the function body as an RDB-string-encoded blob, and ends with a CRC64 footer. That is the same envelope vendored uses, so `FUNCTION RESTORE` works across both servers in either direction.

### Replication: offset arithmetic, FSM, and the backlog window

Replication is governed by three small invariants:

```
primary_offset      = total bytes of write-stream emitted so far
replica_ack_offset  = bytes the replica has confirmed receiving
lag_bytes           = primary_offset - replica_ack_offset    (saturating)
```

Offset arithmetic is saturating in both directions, so an ACK that briefly arrives ahead of the primary's local counter (clock drift, retransmit) cannot wrap a `u64`. `WAIT n_replicas timeout_ms` blocks the calling client until at least `n` replicas have an `ack_offset >= primary_offset_at_call_time` or the deadline fires. `WAITAOF` is the same shape but counts replicas whose **fsync'd** offset has caught up, which matters when the operator wants "the data is durable on the local AOF AND on the replica's AOF" semantics.

The handshake FSM on the replica side is:

```
   ┌───────┐  send PING        ┌────────────┐
   │ Init  │ ──────────────────│ PingSeen   │
   └───────┘                   └─────┬──────┘
                                     │  primary needs AUTH?

                              ┌────────────┐
                              │ AuthSeen   │  (otherwise skipped)
                              └─────┬──────┘
                                    │ send REPLCONF listening-port, capa eof, capa psync2
                                    ▼

                            └─────┬────────┘
                                  │ send PSYNC <repl-id> <offset>
                                  ▼
                          ┌────────────────┐
                          │ PsyncSent      │
                          └─────┬──────────┘
                                │ decide_psync():

                                ▼
                          ┌─────────────┐
                          │ Online      │ ── REPLCONF ACK every ~1s ─┐
                          └─────┬───────┘                            │
                                │                                    │
                                └─────── socket drops? ──────────────┘
                                          reconnect with backoff,
                                          restart from Init.
```

The primary keeps a `BacklogWindow` (a ring of recent write-stream bytes) so that a CONTINUE can serve a reconnecting replica without falling back to FULLRESYNC. `repl-backlog-size` is hot-reloadable via `CONFIG SET`; the window is recomputed without dropping connected replicas.

Replica chaining (replica-of-a-replica) works because the intermediate replica forwards its own primary-write-stream-bytes downstream; the downstream sees a normal primary, just with a different run-id. Integration tests exercise both `legacy-redis-primary → fr-replica` and `fr-primary → fr-replica → fr-downstream-replica` end-to-end.

### PSYNC continuation: a worked numeric example

Suppose a primary has been running for a while and the backlog window holds bytes from primary offset `300_000` (oldest) through `1_000_000` (newest). A replica disconnects briefly and reconnects:

```
Replica state at reconnect:
  cached_master_repl_id = "5c4b3a..."
  last_acked_offset     = 950_000

Replica sends:
  PSYNC 5c4b3a... 950000

Primary's decide_psync runs two checks (fr-repl::decide_psync):
  1. requested_replid.eq_ignore_ascii_case(backlog.replid)  →  YES
  2. backlog.contains(requested_offset = 950000)             →  YES
     (the backlog window is [300000, 1000000], so 950000 is in range)

Primary responds:
  +CONTINUE <replid>
  (no new repl-id needed because the existing one still matches)

Primary then streams the 50_000 missing bytes from offset 950000 to 1000000
and resumes normal write propagation. No RDB snapshot is sent.
```

If any check fails (replica had stale repl-id, or its offset is older than the backlog's oldest byte, or the gap exceeds the configured `repl-backlog-size`), the primary falls back to:

```
+FULLRESYNC <new-repl-id> 1000000
<RDB snapshot stream>
<resume normal propagation>
```

The CONTINUE path is essentially free; the FULLRESYNC path requires forking a child to snapshot the keyspace and streaming the whole dataset. `repl-backlog-size` exists to let operators trade memory for the probability that any given disconnect can recover via CONTINUE. As a rule of thumb, set it to `peak write throughput × tolerable disconnect window`.

## Algorithm deep-dives

Redis is a collection of small, well-chosen algorithms, each solving one observable behavior efficiently. FrankenRedis re-implements all of them in safe Rust. The notable ones:

### HyperLogLog (PFADD / PFCOUNT / PFMERGE)

PFADD/PFCOUNT estimate the cardinality of a multiset in 12 KiB of memory with ~0.81% standard error. The math is the Flajolet/Fusy/Gandouet/Meunier 2007 HyperLogLog algorithm, with the Heule et al. 2013 "HyperLogLog in Practice" small-cardinality and bias corrections.

```
For each element x added via PFADD:
  h = murmur3-style 64-bit hash of x
  i = high 14 bits of h        (selects one of 2^14 = 16384 registers)
  w = remaining 50 bits of h
  M[i] = max( M[i], 1 + position_of_first_1_bit_in(w) )

PFCOUNT then estimates cardinality from the 16384 registers using the
HLL harmonic-mean formula plus the small/large cardinality bias corrections.
```

FrankenRedis uses Redis-compatible **sparse** encoding for low-cardinality sketches and promotes to the dense representation (`16389 bytes = 16384 6-bit registers packed into 12 KiB plus a 5-byte HLL_DENSE header`) once the sparse form is no longer efficient. This preserves the memory advantage for workloads with many small HLL keys.

`PFMERGE` produces a union by taking the register-wise max across the inputs. `PFDEBUG GETREG/DECODE/ENCODING/TODENSE` inspect or convert the encoding. `PFSELFTEST` is the upstream-defined self-check covering register bit-packing and hash-distribution invariants.

### Geo (GEOADD / GEOSEARCH / …)

Geo data is stored *inside a sorted set*; there is no separate geo type. The score is a 52-bit interleaved geohash, computed by quantizing latitude and longitude into bit streams and interleaving them:

```
For each (lon, lat) pair:
  lon_bits = quantize(lon, -180..+180, 26 bits)
  lat_bits = quantize(lat, -85.05..+85.05, 26 bits)
  hash    = interleave_bits(lon_bits, lat_bits)   // 52 total bits
  ZADD key hash member
```

This gives two useful properties: (1) **nearby points have similar scores**, so `ZRANGEBYSCORE` over a tight score range is approximately a bounding-box query in geo space; (2) the inverse, `decode_geohash(score) → (lon, lat)`, is exact within the 26-bit quantization.

`GEOSEARCH FROMLONLAT lon lat BYRADIUS r m` works by:

1. Computing a coarse outer bounding geohash range that's guaranteed to contain every point within `r` meters of `(lon, lat)`.
2. Pulling all members whose score is in that range (a `ZRANGEBYSCORE`).
3. For each candidate, computing the **haversine** great-circle distance and discarding those farther than `r`.

`GEODIST` is just step 3 between two members. The whole module is a few hundred lines of math on top of `fr-store`'s ZSet, with no separate index.

### BITFIELD: atomic multi-counter ops on a single string

`BITFIELD key GET|SET|INCRBY|OVERFLOW type offset [value]` lets you treat a single Redis string as a packed array of fixed-width signed (`i#`) or unsigned (`u#`) integers, and do **multiple operations atomically** in one call:

```
BITFIELD counter SET u8 0 42 INCRBY i16 #1 -3 OVERFLOW SAT INCRBY u4 #2 15
```

- `u8 0`: 8-bit unsigned int starting at byte 0
- `i16 #1`: signed 16-bit int starting at offset `1 * 16 = 16` bits (the `#` prefix multiplies by the type width)
- `u4 #2`: 4-bit unsigned int starting at offset `2 * 4 = 8` bits
- `OVERFLOW {WRAP|SAT|FAIL}` selects what happens on overflow per Redis spec: WRAP (silent two's-complement wrap), SAT (saturate at type min/max), FAIL (return nil)

FrankenRedis enforces the upstream **4 GiB bit-offset ceiling** on every operation (a parity fix from the April–May sweep) and clamps overflow per the active `OVERFLOW` mode. The single-call atomicity is real because the operations run inside one synchronous `BITFIELD` handler, so no other client can observe an intermediate state.

### Active-expire pulse (the lazy/active hybrid)

Redis uses a two-pronged TTL strategy: **lazy** expiry (any access to an expired key drops it before returning the not-found reply) plus an **active** background cycle that periodically scans expiring keys. FrankenRedis ships both:

```
fn run_active_expire_cycle(now_ms, start_cursor, sample_limit):
  // Pull `sample_limit` keys starting from the cursor position in
  // the sorted `ordered_keys` index (wrapping around at the end).
  keys = ordered_keys.range(start_cursor..).take(sample_limit).chain(...wraparound...)

  evicted = 0
  for key in keys:
    if evaluate_expiry(now_ms, entry.expires_at_ms).should_evict:
      emit_keyspace_event("expired", key)
      remove(key)
      evicted += 1

  return ActiveExpireCycleResult { sampled, evicted, next_cursor }
```

This is a **deterministic cursor-based scan** rather than the random-sampling-with-25%-recurrence heuristic upstream uses. Every expiring key is eventually visited as the cursor walks the keyspace; the budget bound (`sample_limit`) prevents any one tick from monopolizing the loop. The trade-off versus upstream is more predictable progress and simpler reasoning, at slightly higher cost on workloads where most expirations cluster temporally. The cursor is persisted across ticks so the scan is fair across the keyspace, not biased toward whatever is at the front of the index.

### LRU / LFU eviction

`maxmemory-policy {allkeys-lru, volatile-lru, allkeys-lfu, volatile-lfu, allkeys-random, volatile-random, volatile-ttl, noeviction}` triggers when adding a key would exceed `maxmemory`. Two pieces of FrankenRedis behavior are worth calling out explicitly because they differ from vendored Redis:

1. **Eviction selection samples candidates.** `select_eviction_candidate` samples up to `maxmemory-samples` keys, then chooses the lowest access time (LRU), lowest decayed frequency (LFU), or nearest expiry (`volatile-ttl`) within that sample. Upstream additionally retains a sorted `EVPOOL_SIZE = 16` candidate pool across eviction rounds; FrankenRedis samples fresh each round.
2. **LFU selection uses the decayed 8-bit frequency.** The counter is tracked per-`Entry` and exposed via `OBJECT FREQ`, using the standard logarithmic increment and minute-resolution decay arithmetic. Ties are resolved by access time and key bytes for deterministic selection.

The remaining difference from upstream's eviction pool affects throughput and which key is selected under pressure, but not the observable `OBJECT IDLETIME` / `OBJECT FREQ` contracts or the `evicted_keys` counter.

The LFU counter itself follows upstream `evict.c`: logarithmic increment so a hot key doesn't saturate the 8-bit counter to 255 immediately (it grows roughly like `log_2(access_count)` modulated by `lfu-log-factor`), plus a separate decay (`lfu-decay-time` minutes) so a once-hot-then-cold key doesn't stick forever.

### Glob matching (KEYS, SCAN MATCH, PSUBSCRIBE, ACL `~pattern`, …)

The same `glob_match` engine in `fr-store` powers every place Redis accepts a pattern:

```
*    matches zero or more bytes
?    matches exactly one byte
[ab] matches one byte in the class
[^ab] matches one byte NOT in the class
[a-z] character ranges inside a class
\x   escapes the next character literally
```

It is implemented as a recursive descent matcher with a single-byte lookahead, the same shape as upstream `stringmatchlen()`, chosen because it is straightforward to fuzz to byte-for-byte parity. The `fuzz_glob_match` target keeps it honest against vendored.

### Listpack encoding format

Small hashes, sets, sorted sets, and stream entries are stored in **listpack** form to amortize allocation and cache cost. The on-disk byte layout (what `fr-persist` reads/writes) is:

```
+--------------------------+
| total_bytes (4 bytes)    |  little-endian
| num_elements (2 bytes)   |  little-endian (0xFFFF = "use forward scan")
+--------------------------+
| entry 0                  |
| entry 1                  |
| ...                      |
+--------------------------+
| end_marker (0xFF)        |
+--------------------------+

Each entry:
  encoding byte (1)         high bits select one of:
                              7-bit unsigned int (1 byte total)
                              6-bit length string (1+N bytes)
                              13-bit signed int
                              12-bit length string
                              16/24/32/64-bit signed int
                              16-bit length string
                              32-bit length string
  payload (variable)
  back-pointer (variable)   length encoded in 1-5 bytes; encodes the
                            position to walk backward in O(1)
```

The back-pointer makes listpack a **bidirectional** container; `LRANGE end -1` is as cheap to start from as `LRANGE 0 1`. FrankenRedis's standalone listpack decoder lives in `crates/fr-persist/src/listpack.rs` and is reused by both the RDB decoder (for upstream macro-node entries) and the stream entry parser.

### Pub/Sub fan-out cost model

Channel subscribers are tracked in two hash maps on `ServerState`:

```rust
pubsub_channel_subs: HashMap<Vec<u8>, HashSet<ClientId>>,   // channel → subscribers
pubsub_pattern_subs: HashMap<Vec<u8>, HashSet<ClientId>>,   // glob pattern → subscribers
pubsub_shard_subs:   HashMap<Vec<u8>, HashSet<ClientId>>,   // shard channel → subscribers
```

Cost of `PUBLISH channel msg`:
- Channel lookup: `O(1)`, direct hash hit.
- Per-pattern check: `O(num_patterns × glob_match_cost)`; every registered pattern is tested.
- Total: `O(num_channel_subs + num_pattern_subs)`; every subscriber gets the message appended to a per-client `pubsub_outbox` (a `HashMap<ClientId, Vec<PubSubMessage>>` on `ServerState`) in the same poll tick.

Cross-client delivery walks the subscriber set, pushes one `PubSubMessage::{Message,PMessage,SMessage}` envelope per subscriber into the outbox, and the event loop drains the outbox into each client's `write_buf` (encoding it as `*3\r\n$7\r\nmessage\r\n$<n>\r\n<channel>\r\n$<m>\r\n<payload>\r\n`) before the next `FileDispatch` phase flushes the buffers. There's no inter-thread queue because there's no second thread.

### Why a single-threaded mio loop (and not `tokio` / a thread pool)?

Operators ask about this choice often. Three reasons:

1. **Determinism.** Redis's behavior model is "one logical thread, commands execute atomically in arrival order." Multi-threading the data path means giving up that model; Dragonfly and KeyDB both had to invent per-shard sharding or per-connection serialization to recover something like it. FrankenRedis preserves the original semantics by inheriting the original design.
2. **Latency predictability.** A single-threaded mio loop has no lock contention, no context-switch jitter, no false-sharing across cores. The sub-millisecond p50 latency numbers in the Performance section fall out of that directly.
3. **Cognitive load.** The whole runtime fits in one synchronous mental model: read bytes, parse, dispatch, mutate, encode, write. There is no `tokio::spawn` to reason about, no `Arc<Mutex<...>>` over the store, no `async` color anywhere in the data path. The 5,076 conformance fixtures and 33 fuzz targets are all easier to write because of this. (An experimental per-core reactor mode, `--experimental-sharded-set-get-workers`, exists for single-key workloads; the default server is the single-threaded loop described here.)

The trade-off is that a single-threaded server doesn't scale across cores for raw throughput. Neither does vendored Redis, and the established operational pattern (one Redis process per core, partitioned by application sharding or by cluster) applies unchanged to FrankenRedis.

### Wire trace: `SET hello world` byte for byte

The literal hex of a `SET hello world` request and reply, for grounding:

```
Request                                          (35 bytes on the wire)
00000000  2a 33 0d 0a 24 33 0d 0a  53 45 54 0d 0a 24 35 0d   |*3..$3..SET..$5.|
00000010  0a 68 65 6c 6c 6f 0d 0a  24 35 0d 0a 77 6f 72 6c   |.hello..$5..worl|
00000020  64 0d 0a                                            |d..|

Reply                                              (5 bytes on the wire)
00000000  2b 4f 4b 0d 0a                                      |+OK..|
```

Reading the request:
- `*3\r\n` — RESP array header, 3 elements
- `$3\r\nSET\r\n` — bulk string of length 3 with payload `SET`
- `$5\r\nhello\r\n` — bulk string of length 5 with payload `hello`
- `$5\r\nworld\r\n` — bulk string of length 5 with payload `world`

Reading the reply: `+OK\r\n` is a RESP simple string carrying `OK`.

Every fixture in `fr-conformance` is some variation of this: argv in, expected reply out, then the harness checks the wire bytes against vendored Redis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rust nightly** (the workspace uses Rust 2024 edition; the pin lives in `rust-toolchain.toml`).
- **A C toolchain** if you want to also build the vendored Redis under `legacy_redis_code/redis/` for differential testing.
- **Tcl 8.5+** if you want to run Redis 7.2.4's upstream Tcl tests directly against FrankenRedis.
- **`redis-server`** on your `PATH` if you want to run ad-hoc live differential gates without the pinned vendored copy.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenredis
cd frankenredis

# Single binary, default release profile (plain cargo defaults; see below)
cargo build --release -p fr-server

./target/release/frankenredis --help
```

The workspace `Cargo.toml` does not override `[profile.release]`, so a plain
`--release` build uses cargo's defaults (`opt-level = 3`, `lto = false`,
`codegen-units = 16`, `strip = "none"`). Performance claims are measured on the
dedicated `[profile.release-perf]` profile the workspace root defines
(`inherits = "release"`, `lto = "thin"`, `codegen-units = 1`,
`debug = "line-tables-only"`); build it with `--profile release-perf`.

### Build the bench harness

```bash
cargo build --release -p fr-bench
./target/release/fr-bench --help
```

### Build the conformance harness

```bash
cargo build --release -p fr-conformance --bin live_oracle_diff
./target/release/live_oracle_diff --help
```

### Workspace check / lint / test

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test  --workspace
```

If you have `rch` (remote compilation helper) installed, all of the above can be offloaded transparently; see `AGENTS.md` for the multi-agent build conventions.

## Quick start

### Standalone server

```bash
./target/release/frankenredis \
  --bind 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 6379 \
  --mode strict \
  --aof ./data/appendonly.aof \
  --rdb ./data/dump.rdb
```

### Primary + replica + sentinel

```bash
# Primary
./target/release/frankenredis --port 6379 --aof p.aof --rdb p.rdb &

# Replica (connects to primary; FULLRESYNC then CONTINUE)
./target/release/frankenredis --port 6380 --aof r.aof --rdb r.rdb \
  --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379 &

# Sentinel (no keyspace; monitors the primary, promotes the replica on failure)
./target/release/frankenredis --port 26379 --sentinel &
redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL MONITOR mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 1
redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL SET mymaster down-after-milliseconds 5000
```

### With auth

```bash
# Primary requires password
./target/release/frankenredis --port 6379 --config primary.conf

# Replica authenticates upstream
./target/release/frankenredis --port 6380 \
  --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379 \
  --masterauth somepassword
```

### Talk to it

Any client that speaks RESP2 or RESP3 works: `redis-cli`, `iredis`, `hiredis`, `lettuce`, `node-redis`, `go-redis`, `redis-py`, etc.

```bash
redis-cli -p 6379
redis-cli -p 6379 --pipe < commands.txt
redis-cli -p 6379 monitor      # streaming MONITOR
redis-cli -p 6379 latency doctor
redis-cli -p 6379 acl whoami
```

## Configuration

FrankenRedis reads `--config <path>` in standard `redis.conf` format. The exact same keys you'd use in vendored Redis 7.2.4 are recognised. CLI flags override config-file values.

A minimal annotated config:

```conf
# ---- Network ----
bind            127.0.0.1
port            6379
tcp-backlog     511

# ---- Auth + ACL ----
# (Compatibility mode itself is a CLI flag: `--mode strict|hardened`,
#  defaulting to strict — no config-file key for it.)
requirepass     "change-me"
# Or load a checked-in users file:
# aclfile       /etc/frankenredis/users.acl

# ---- Persistence ----
appendonly      yes
appendfsync     everysec        # always | everysec | no
dir             /var/lib/frankenredis
dbfilename      dump.rdb

# Background snapshot triggers (Redis style: <seconds> <changes>)
save            3600 1
save            300 100
save            60  10000

# ---- Memory ----
maxmemory       4gb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru     # noeviction | allkeys-lru | allkeys-lfu |
                                  # allkeys-random | volatile-lru | volatile-lfu |
                                  # volatile-ttl  | volatile-random
maxmemory-samples 5

# ---- Replication ----

# replicaof 10.0.0.1 6379
# masterauth "primary-password"

# ---- Lua scripting ----

# ---- Debug surface (default-deny per Redis 7.2) ----
enable-debug-command no
```

`CONFIG GET '*'` returns 230+ live keys (the static-defaults table in `fr-runtime` carries 232 entries; some are aliases for upstream spellings). `CONFIG REWRITE` writes back to the file passed via `--config`. Slave/replica aliases are emitted on both spellings (e.g. `slave-read-only` and `replica-read-only`).

  --experimental-key-sharded-set-get-workers <N>
                                      Key-affinity variant of the above (mutually
                                      exclusive with it)
  --<config-key> <value>              Any redis.conf key, applied through CONFIG
                                      SET at startup (e.g. --maxmemory-policy
                                      allkeys-lru); an unknown key aborts startup
  --help, -h                          Show help
```

## Command surface

All 241 Redis 7.2 base commands are implemented and exposed. The Redis 7.4 `HEXPIRE`/`HTTL`/`HPERSIST` family additionally ships behind the boot-only `--enable-hash-field-ttl yes` opt-in (default `no` keeps 7.2.4 parity: unknown-command replies, and the three are absent from `COMMAND COUNT`/`INFO`/`LIST`/`DOCS` and `ACL CAT`). Counts below are approximate command-name groupings.

## Persistence

### AOF

- Format: RESP-encoded command stream (compatible with stock Redis AOF readers for the implemented command set).
- Manifest-based multi-part layout: base RDB preamble + history files + incremental AOF files tracked in a manifest.
- `appendfsync everysec` / `always` / `no` (defaults to `everysec`).
- Replay policy: `AofReplayTailRepairPolicy::{Disabled, BoundedFinalSegment { max_tail_bytes }, HardenedNonAllowlisted}` selects how aggressively the server is allowed to recover from a torn tail; `BoundedFinalSegment` carries a `max_tail_bytes` cap so a malicious tail can't trigger unbounded repair.
- `BGREWRITEAOF` rewrites the AOF as a Store snapshot to a temp file and atomically swaps.
- AOF replay is fail-closed in strict mode: an unknown command inside a `MULTI` aborts the whole transaction rather than partially applying.

### RDB v11

- LZF compression on strings >20 bytes (pure-Rust port of Marc Lehmann's LZF, byte-for-byte compatible with vendored).
- Opcodes: `AUX` (0xFA), `SELECTDB` (0xFE), `RESIZEDB` (0xFB), `EXPIRETIME_MS` (0xFC), `EOF` (0xFF).
- CRC64 footer using the Redis polynomial.
- Encoder selects a compact upstream type tag per value shape (listpack/intset/hashtable/skiplist/quicklist).
- Decoder handles upstream type tags 11/16/17/18/19/20/21 including the two stream encodings.
- `FUNCTION DUMP` payloads are wrapped in an upstream version + CRC64 envelope so they round-trip through vendored servers.

### Eviction

`maxmemory-policy` covers `noeviction`, `allkeys-lru`, `allkeys-lfu`, `allkeys-random`, `volatile-lru`, `volatile-lfu`, `volatile-random`, `volatile-ttl`. LFU uses the upstream logarithmic counter with `LFU_INIT_VAL = 5` and a `lfu-log-factor` of 10.

## Replication

| Capability | State |
|---|---|
| `--replicaof` CLI bootstrap | ✓ |
| `REPLICAOF` / `SLAVEOF` from clients (incl. `REPLICAOF NO ONE`) | ✓ |
| `PSYNC` handshake (PING → AUTH → REPLCONF → PSYNC) | ✓ |
| `FULLRESYNC` snapshot streaming over TCP | ✓ |
| `CONTINUE` partial backlog replay | ✓ |
| `REPLCONF ACK` offset acknowledgement (no-direct-reply behavior) | ✓ |
| Replica reconnect with backoff | ✓ |
| `min-replicas-to-write` / `min-replicas-max-lag` write admission | ✓ |
| Replica-of-replica chaining | ✓ |
| `WAIT` / `WAITAOF` thresholds with saturating offset arithmetic | ✓ |
| `replica-priority` / `replica-announced` (for sentinel) | ✓ |
| Backlog rotation on `CONFIG SET repl-backlog-size` | ✓ |
| Authenticated upstream via `CONFIG SET masterauth` / `masteruser` | ✓ |

Both directions are exercised end-to-end in integration tests: vendored `redis-server` → FrankenRedis replica, and FrankenRedis primary → FrankenRedis replica → downstream FrankenRedis replica.

## Sentinel

The `fr-sentinel` crate is a clean-room reimplementation of Redis Sentinel, modeled on the same conceptual layers as `redis/src/sentinel.c`. `frankenredis --sentinel` brings a process up in sentinel mode: no keyspace, the `SENTINEL` command surface, and a monitoring tick that PINGs, INFOs and gossips on every monitored master and every replica it discovers. The failover state machine in `fr-sentinel::failover` is pure; the server loop drives it once a second and performs the `SLAVEOF` writes it asks for (`fr_sentinel::failover::failover_step`), so both `SENTINEL FAILOVER` and automatic failover after O_DOWN promote the best replica, reconfigure the rest, and demote a former master that comes back. Sentinels also exchange `SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR` questions over persistent non-blocking links (a blocking ask deadlocks three single-threaded sentinels that ask each other in the same tick), so O_DOWN for a quorum above 1 rests on the peers' answers; the failover is upstream's two-step election (claim an epoch, ask for votes in the same tick, win a majority and at least `quorum` ballots, or abort at the election timeout), and a sentinel that lost learns the new master from the leader's hello on the promoted replica's channel. A replica that reports `role:master` is only converted back once this sentinel's own master looks sane and the role has held for four publish periods, as upstream's convert-to-slave path does; without that grace a follower demoted the replica a peer had just promoted. Sentinel config files (`sentinel monitor ...` directives) and notification scripts are also still open; masters are registered at runtime with `SENTINEL MONITOR`.

## ACL

Full lifecycle:

```bash
redis-cli ACL SETUSER alice on \
    '>s3cret' \
    '~cache:*' '~session:*' '-@all' '+@read' '+@string' '+set' '-del'
redis-cli ACL WHOAMI
redis-cli ACL LIST
redis-cli ACL DRYRUN alice GET cache:foo
redis-cli ACL LOG RESET
redis-cli ACL SAVE
```

| Feature | State |
|---|---|
| Per-command `+cmd` / `-cmd` | ✓ |
| Per-category `+@cat` / `-@cat` | ✓ |
| `allcommands` / `nocommands` / `allkeys` / `allchannels` / `reset` | ✓ |
| Key patterns `~pattern` | ✓ |
| Channel patterns `&pattern` | ✓ |
| Deny-first precedence at dispatch (`explicit deny > explicit allow > category deny > category allow`) | ✓ |
| ACL log with negative-count clamp | ✓ |
| `ACL SAVE` / `ACL LOAD` against an ACL file | ✓ |
| `%R` / `%W` / `%RW` key selectors (Redis 7.0 feature) | not yet (tracked as parity bead) |

### ACL precedence: a worked example

The deny-first precedence rule means each command/key check walks the user's rule list **in declaration order**, with explicit entries beating category entries and the last matching rule winning within each tier. The full priority is:

```
explicit deny  >  explicit allow  >  category deny  >  category allow  >  base policy
```

To make this concrete, consider:

```
ACL SETUSER alice on '>s3cret' \
    '~cache:*' '~session:*' \
    '-@all' '+@read' '+@string' '+set' '-del'
```

Now trace each request:

| Command attempt | Walk | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `GET cache:foo`     | `~cache:*` matches key. `+@read` allows GET (category allow). No later explicit/category deny touches GET. | **allowed** |
| `SET cache:foo bar` | Key matches. `+set` is an explicit allow (beats `-@all` category deny). | **allowed** |
| `DEL cache:foo`     | Key matches. `-del` is an explicit deny, top of the precedence stack. | **denied** |
| `SET foo bar`       | Key `foo` is **not in** `~cache:*`/`~session:*`, so it fails the key-pattern test before ACL even looks at commands. | **denied (NOKEY)** |
| `HGETALL session:42`| Key matches. HGETALL is in `@read`. `+@read` allows. | **allowed** |
| `FLUSHDB`           | FLUSHDB is in `@admin`/`@dangerous`. `-@all` denied at category level; no explicit allow. | **denied** |

`ACL DRYRUN alice <command>` runs exactly this walk without executing the command and replies with the same OK/error you'd actually get, which makes it ideal for staging permission changes. `ACL CAT <category>` lists what's in each category so you can see why `+@read` covers `HGETALL` but not `HSET`.

## Conformance harness

FrankenRedis deliberately uses multiple independent fidelity layers. The 5,076-case corpus is strong bespoke differential coverage; it is **not** presented as a substitute for upstream Redis's own tests.

```bash
# Run the in-process conformance suite (FrankenRedis runtime vs declared expectations)
cargo test -p fr-conformance -- --nocapture

# Run a single fixture in `command` mode against a live vendored Redis 7.2.4
# on host:port. The binary takes positional <mode> <fixture> [host] [port]
# plus optional --log-root / --json-out / --run-id / --case flags.
cargo run -p fr-conformance --bin live_oracle_diff -- \
    command crates/fr-conformance/fixtures/core_zset.json 127.0.0.1 6390

# Orchestrate the broader Redis-vs-FrankenRedis parity matrix.
cargo run -p fr-conformance --bin live_oracle_orchestrator -- --matrix parity
```

### Redis 7.2.4's own upstream Tcl tests

The repository now runs the **unmodified upstream Redis 7.2.4 test harness itself** against FrankenRedis. CI checks out Redis at the exact release commit `d2c8a4b91e8c0e6aefd1f5bc0bf582cddbe046b7`, builds its test-support binaries, and uses upstream's native external-server support (`runtest --host/--port`).

There are two upstream lanes:

- `scripts/upstream_redis_tcl_fidelity.py`: a fast, blocking anti-vacuity gate over 72 selected client-visible assertions spanning strings, integer arithmetic, keyspace semantics, transactions, and protocol behavior.
- `scripts/upstream_redis_tcl_full.py`: the complete default external-mode lane. It obtains the unit inventory from `runtest --list-tests`, schedules every listed unit, requires each one to complete exactly once, preserves Redis's own `external:skip` decisions, detects early FrankenRedis exits/timeouts/partial runs, and emits a structured JSON report plus the raw Tcl log.

The dedicated workflow is `.github/workflows/upstream-redis-7.2.4-full.yml`. It runs on relevant changes to `main`, nightly, and manually. Automatic runs publish the full evidence even while remaining incompatibilities are being closed; release candidates are required by `AGENTS.md` to dispatch the workflow with **`enforce=true`**, making the complete upstream verdict blocking.

Redis also ships separate `runtest-cluster`, `runtest-sentinel`, and `runtest-moduleapi` entrypoints. Those are different evidence classes: cluster/Sentinel own multi-process topologies, while module API tests build and load native Redis C modules. They are not silently counted as passing external-server tests.

Total: **5,076 cases across 46 fixture files** (counted from the JSON on disk at 2026-09-02; the tree above lists the families by size at the time it was drawn). Each case carries an `argv`, a `now_ms`, and an `ExpectedFrame` (`Simple` / `Error` / `Integer` / `Bulk` / `Array` / `SimplePattern` with `{hex40}` and `{int}` placeholders). Some carry threat-event expectations and structured-log contracts.

### Differential testing

The harness can execute the same case on both FrankenRedis and a live Redis 7.2.4 oracle and compare RESP frames byte-for-byte. Field-ordering canonicalization keeps RESP3 Map/Set replies stable across runs. An exemption audit file (`live_oracle_audit_exemptions.json`, schema `live_oracle_audit_exemptions/v2`) lists fixtures intentionally excluded from a particular live-oracle matrix because they require specialized harnesses (multi-client blocking, dedicated replication-handshake harness, dedicated persist-replay path, TLS-enabled oracle); each exemption records its replacement coverage.

The main conformance workflow pins the oracle to Redis 7.2.4 and runs the broad `parity` matrix. The separate complete-upstream workflow runs Redis's own default Tcl suite and preserves its report as release evidence.

## Observability

FrankenRedis emits the same observability surface Redis operators are used to, plus a few additions driven by the threat-event ledger.

### `INFO`

`INFO` returns these sections (use `INFO server` etc. to scope, or `INFO all` for everything):

| Section | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `server` | `redis_version` (advertised as `7.2.4` for client compatibility), `run_id`, `tcp_port`, `process_id`, `uptime_in_seconds`, `uptime_in_days`, `arch_bits`, `os`, etc. ~21 fields |
| `clients` | `connected_clients`, `cluster_connections`, `maxclients`, `client_recent_max_input_buffer`, `client_recent_max_output_buffer`, `blocked_clients`, etc. |
| `memory` | `used_memory`, `used_memory_rss` (read from `/proc/self/status`), `used_memory_peak`, `maxmemory`, `maxmemory_policy`, `mem_fragmentation_ratio`, etc. |
| `persistence` | `loading`, `rdb_changes_since_last_save` (dirty counter), `rdb_bgsave_in_progress`, `rdb_last_save_time`, `aof_enabled`, `aof_rewrite_in_progress`, `aof_last_bgrewrite_status`, `aof_last_write_status`, etc. Not emitted: the AOF *sizing* group upstream prints when `appendonly yes` — `aof_current_size`, `aof_base_size`, `aof_pending_rewrite`, `aof_buffer_length`, `aof_pending_bio_fsync`, `aof_delayed_fsync` (`frankenredis-w1djx`). |
| `stats` | `total_connections_received`, `total_commands_processed`, `instantaneous_ops_per_sec`, `total_net_input_bytes`, `total_net_output_bytes`, `rejected_connections`, `expired_keys`, `evicted_keys`, etc. |
| `cpu` | `used_cpu_sys`, `used_cpu_user`, `used_cpu_sys_children`, `used_cpu_user_children` |
| `replication` | `role`, `connected_slaves`, `master_replid`, `master_repl_offset`, plus per-replica lines; on a replica, `master_host`, `master_link_status`, `slave_priority`, `slave_read_only`, `replica_announced`. Not emitted: `min_slaves_good_slaves` (the only `min_slaves_*` field upstream puts in this section) and the `master_sync_*` progress fields (`frankenredis-w1djx`). |
| `commandstats` | per-command `calls`, `usec`, `usec_per_call`, `rejected_calls`, `failed_calls` |
| `errorstats` | per-error-prefix counts (e.g., `errorstat_WRONGTYPE:count=N`) |
| `latencystats` | per-event latency-monitor entries |
| `keyspace` | per-database `keys=N,expires=N,avg_ttl=N` |

### `SLOWLOG` and `LATENCY`

`SLOWLOG GET [n]` returns the last `slowlog-max-len` commands whose execution exceeded `slowlog-log-slower-than` microseconds, each with a unique id, a client name/address, and the full argv. `LATENCY HISTORY <event>` and `LATENCY DOCTOR` work the same way they do upstream and are wired through real timing instrumentation around the dispatch path.

### `MONITOR`

`MONITOR` streams every successful command back to the subscribing client in the canonical `<unix-ts.us> [<db> <client>] <argv...>` format, exactly as Redis does. Use it to debug client traffic in dev; never enable it in production-hot paths.

### `CLIENT LIST` / `CLIENT INFO`

`CLIENT LIST` returns one line per connected client with the standard fields: `id addr laddr fd name age idle flags db sub psub ssub multi qbuf qbuf-free argv-mem multi-mem rbs rbp obl oll omem tot-mem events cmd user redir resp lib-name lib-ver`. The flag string preserves the upstream alphabet (`e` evicted, `T` no-touch, `t` keys-tracking, `B` blocked, `P` pubsub, `r` readonly, `x` MULTI/EXEC, …) so existing dashboards and parsers keep working.

### Keyspace notifications

`CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events <flags>` (e.g. `AKE` for all-keyspace + all-key-events) wires Redis-style `__keyspace@<db>__:<key>` and `__keyevent@<db>__:<event>` publication. Event names match upstream for `BITOP`, `PFADD`, `*STORE`, `XGROUP`, the blocking-pop family, and the rest, all pinned during the April–May parity sweeps.

### Threat-event ledger

In hardened mode, every `ThreatEvent` (see Implementation deep-dives → Threat-event ledger format) is appended to a JSON-lines file, `threat-ledger.jsonl` in the working directory by default (next to `dump.rdb`). The path is the fr-only config key `threat-ledger-file`, settable at startup (`--threat-ledger-file /var/log/frankenredis/threats.jsonl`) or at runtime with `CONFIG SET`; an empty value turns the file off. The key answers an exact-name `CONFIG GET` but stays out of `CONFIG GET *` so the visible key set remains byte-exact with Redis 7.2.4. Each row is a `fr_threat_ledger_v1` object carrying the timestamp, packet id, mode, severity, threat class, decision action, subsystem, action, reason code and reason, the SHA-256 digests of input, output and store state, the replay command and artifact references; payload bytes are never written, only digests (the redaction rule of `docs/planning/TEST_LOG_SCHEMA_V1.md`). The server appends once per event-loop iteration, keeps at most 10,000 events in memory, and counts (rather than silently drops) rows it could not write. Strict mode records the same events in memory and writes a file only when `threat-ledger-file` is set.

---

## Embedding `fr-*` crates in your own project

The workspace is structured so the most useful internals can be lifted into other Rust projects without depending on the full server. Common patterns:

### Parse and emit RESP without running a server

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
fr-protocol = { path = "../frankenredis/crates/fr-protocol" }
```

```rust
use fr_protocol::{ParseResult, ParserConfig, RespFrame, parse_frame_with_config};

let cfg = ParserConfig {
    max_bulk_len: 16 * 1024 * 1024,   // 16 MiB per bulk
    max_array_len: 1_000_000,
    max_recursion_depth: 32,
    allow_resp3: true,                // opt-in; default is false (fail-closed)
};

let ParseResult { frame, consumed } =
    parse_frame_with_config(b"*1\r\n$4\r\nPING\r\n", &cfg)?;
assert_eq!(consumed, 14);
assert!(matches!(frame, RespFrame::Array(_)));

// Encoding is a method on RespFrame:
let mut out = Vec::with_capacity(64);
RespFrame::SimpleString("PONG".into()).encode_into(&mut out);
assert_eq!(out, b"+PONG\r\n");
```

This gives you a hardened RESP2/3 codec with CRLF-injection sanitization and configurable limits, useful for proxies, gateways, or anywhere you need to speak RESP without owning a key/value store. The default `ParserConfig::default()` keeps `allow_resp3 = false` to preserve the fail-closed posture on untrusted input.

### Use the data engine as a typed in-memory store

```toml
[dependencies]
fr-store = { path = "../frankenredis/crates/fr-store" }
```

```rust
use fr_store::Store;

let mut store = Store::new();
let now_ms: u64 = 1_778_889_600_000;

// SET hello world (no TTL):
store.set(b"hello".to_vec(), b"world".to_vec(), None, now_ms);
let v = store.get(b"hello", now_ms).unwrap().unwrap();
assert_eq!(v, b"world");

// SET with a 5-second PX TTL:
store.set(b"session:42".to_vec(), b"alice".to_vec(), Some(5_000), now_ms);

// ZSet with full upstream-compatible ordering (total_cmp on f64, lex tie-break):
store
    .zadd(
        b"leaderboard",
        &[(1.0, b"alice".to_vec()), (3.5, b"bob".to_vec())],
        now_ms,
    )
    .unwrap();
let asc = store.zrange(b"leaderboard", 0, -1, now_ms).unwrap();
// asc == ["alice", "bob"];  use zrevrange for descending.
```

Most `Store` mutators take a trailing `now_ms: u64` because expiry, LFU decay, and `OBJECT IDLETIME` all consult it. Pass a real wall-clock time in milliseconds, or a deterministic value if you're driving from a test harness.

### Replay RDB or AOF outside the server

```toml
[dependencies]
fr-persist = { path = "../frankenredis/crates/fr-persist" }
```

```rust
use fr_persist::{decode_rdb, decode_aof_stream};

let bytes = std::fs::read("dump.rdb")?;
let (entries, aux) = decode_rdb(&bytes)?;
println!("snapshot taken by redis-ver = {:?}", aux.get("redis-ver"));
for entry in entries {
    println!("db={} key={:?} expire_ms={:?}",
             entry.db, entry.key, entry.expire_ms);
}

let aof_bytes = std::fs::read("appendonly.aof")?;
let records = decode_aof_stream(&aof_bytes)?;
for rec in records {
    println!("AOF: {:?}", rec.argv);
}
```

Both decoders accept vendored Redis 7.2.4 files unmodified. Handy for forensic tooling, migrations, or building an offline RDB inspector.

### Drive the runtime without owning a socket

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
fr-runtime = { path = "../frankenredis/crates/fr-runtime" }
fr-config  = { path = "../frankenredis/crates/fr-config" }
fr-protocol = { path = "../frankenredis/crates/fr-protocol" }
```

```rust
use fr_config::RuntimePolicy;
use fr_runtime::Runtime;

let mut rt = Runtime::new(RuntimePolicy::default());          // strict mode
// or:  Runtime::new(RuntimePolicy::hardened())               // hardened mode

let now_ms: u64 = 1_778_889_600_000;
let reply = rt.execute_bytes(
    b"*3\r\n$3\r\nSET\r\n$3\r\nfoo\r\n$3\r\nbar\r\n",
    now_ms,
);
assert!(reply.ends_with(b"+OK\r\n"));
```

`Runtime` exposes `execute_bytes`, `execute_frame`, and `execute_frame_with_unix_time_us` for tests, embedded use, or building alternative front-ends (UDP gateway, Unix-socket-only deployments, HTTP/JSON adapter). `RuntimePolicy::default()` selects strict mode with an empty hardened allowlist; `RuntimePolicy::hardened()` selects hardened mode pre-loaded with `HARDENED_ALLOWLIST_DEFAULT`.

### Build a custom benchmark harness

`fr-bench` is fully scriptable and `cargo install --path crates/fr-bench` will drop a `fr-bench` binary in your `~/.cargo/bin`. Workloads are normalized to a `frankenredis_baseline/v1` JSON schema you can diff against any vendored or upstream baseline.

---

## Benchmarking methodology

The Performance table above is the surface report; this is how the harness actually produces those numbers.

### What `fr-bench` measures

`fr-bench` is a TCP load generator written specifically for FrankenRedis but speaking standard RESP2, so it works against any Redis-compatible server. For each workload it:

1. Opens `--clients` TCP connections (default: 50) and authenticates if needed.
2. Pre-fills the keyspace where the workload requires it (e.g. `LPOP` needs lists populated).
3. Drives `--requests` total operations (default: 100,000) round-robin across the connections.
4. For each request, samples `(send_unix_us, recv_unix_us)` and records `(recv − send)` into a `Histogram<u64>` (HdrHistogram, max value 60 s) at microsecond precision.
5. At the end, computes `p50`, `p95`, `p99`, `p999`, `max`, `mean`, `samples`, plus `ops_per_sec = requests / total_time_sec`, `bytes_sent`, and `bytes_received`.

Results are normalized into the `frankenredis_baseline/v1` JSON schema. Eight workload variants ship:

| Workload | Shape |
|---|---|
| `set`   | `SET key value` with a 3-byte payload (configurable via `--datasize`) |
| `get`   | `GET key` (after pre-fill) |
| `incr`  | `INCR key` |
| `lpush` | `LPUSH key value` |
| `lpop`  | `LPOP key` (after pre-fill of `requests / keyspace / pipeline` per key) |
| `hset`  | `HSET key field value` |
| `hget`  | `HGET key field` (after pre-fill) |
| `mixed` | 50% `GET` / 50% `SET` blend |

### Pipelining

`--pipeline N` sends `N` RESP commands per round-trip without waiting. That mode produces the `pipeline=16` numbers in the Performance table. Pipelined latency is intentionally higher per-request (the request waits for `N−1` siblings to also clear the queue) but throughput goes up substantially: Redis can do nearly an order of magnitude more ops/sec at `pipeline=16` than at `pipeline=1`.

### Why HdrHistogram

Mean and median latency are misleading for server workloads; the long tail is where user-visible jitter actually comes from. HdrHistogram lets you read `p99`, `p99.9`, and `max` with constant-time queries on a fixed-memory data structure with bounded relative precision. The harness uses microsecond buckets up to 60 s, which is enough headroom that no real request ever clips the top of the histogram (it would mean a 60-second timeout).

### The regression gate

`./scripts/benchmark_gate.sh` runs fresh `fr-bench` captures, compares them to the checked-in baselines, and exits non-zero if any workload regresses past the configured thresholds:

```bash
FR_BENCH_THROUGHPUT_DROP_PCT=10   # fail if throughput drops more than 10%
FR_BENCH_P99_REGRESSION_PCT=20    # fail if p99 grows more than 20%
./scripts/benchmark_gate.sh
```

Each run writes raw per-workload reports, side-by-side comparisons, and an aggregate gate report under `artifacts/benchmark/<run-id>/`. The intent is that any optimization PR can attach the artifacts directory and let a reviewer see "what changed, by how much, and whether it stayed inside the gate."

### Isomorphism proofs

A perf change can be a regression even if every benchmark improves, if it changed observable behavior. Each optimization round therefore produces an `ISOMORPHISM_PROOF_*.md` artifact under `artifacts/optimization/` that argues two things:

1. **Behavior unchanged.** The differential conformance suite still passes against vendored Redis after the change.
2. **The change is the cause.** A before/after `perf record` flamegraph and an `strace` syscall trace show the hotspot moved where the proof says it did.

The lazy `Store::state_digest` + ACL category short-circuit rounds in `artifacts/optimization/throughput-gap/ISOMORPHISM_PROOF_LAZY_DIGEST.md` are a worked example.

## Threat model summary

FrankenRedis defends against five concrete attacker postures. The full matrix is in [`docs/planning/SECURITY_COMPATIBILITY_THREAT_MATRIX_V1.md`](docs/planning/SECURITY_COMPATIBILITY_THREAT_MATRIX_V1.md); the abbreviated form:

| Attacker | What they try | What FrankenRedis does |
|---|---|---|
| **Hostile RESP client** | Oversized bulks, deeply nested arrays, recursion bombs, CRLF injection in error bodies, unknown RESP3 type prefixes | Parser enforces `max_bulk_len`/`max_array_len`/`max_recursion_depth` ceilings; error/string bodies are sanitized for CRLF; unknown RESP3 types in strict mode are rejected as `UnsupportedResp3Type` (fail-closed) |
| **Hostile inline command** | Unbalanced quotes, embedded newlines, malformed numeric arguments | Inline parser returns a RESP error for unbalanced quotes; numeric arguments are parsed with strict integer / float parsers that reject whitespace padding and underflow |
| **Persistence tampering** | RDB CRC64 mismatch, AOF tail with mid-record CRLF, LZF payload claiming impossible decompressed size | RDB CRC mismatch fires `PersistenceTampering` → `FailClosed`; AOF tail repair policy is operator-chosen (`Disabled`/`BoundedFinalSegment`/`HardenedNonAllowlisted`); LZF decoder bounds-checks the claimed length before allocating |
| **Replication order attack** | Out-of-order replication offsets from a forged primary; replica that lies about its run-id; backlog payload with a stitched-in command stream | Offset arithmetic is saturating; FSM rejects PSYNC continuations whose `(repl_id, offset)` doesn't match the local backlog window; `min-replicas-to-write` write admission denies writes when fewer than N replicas have ACK'd within `min-replicas-max-lag` |
| **Auth/ACL confusion** | Privilege escalation via `ACL SETUSER` modifier ordering, deprecated `+@all` after explicit `-cmd`, password reset via `resetpass` ordering | Deny-first precedence at dispatch; explicit-allow after `+@all` preserves the explicit; `resetpass` no longer enables passwordless login on accident; ACL log records every rejected attempt |

In strict mode, the default decision for every threat class is `FailClosed` with severity `S0`; the server never silently bounded-defends. In hardened mode, the operator can allowlist a small set of categories (`BoundedParserDiagnostics`, `BoundedReplayRepair`, `ResourceClamp`, `MetadataSanitization`) where bounded defense is preferable to a hard fail. Every defended event is recorded in the threat-event ledger so the operator sees what happened.

### What FrankenRedis does NOT defend against

- **CPU exhaustion via expensive but legal commands.** A determined adversary with `+KEYS` permission can still ask `KEYS '*'` on a giant keyspace; that's a workload problem, not a security problem. Use ACL to scope what each user can do.
- **TLS interception.** Wire-level TLS is delegated to the operational layer (see Limitations); front the server with `stunnel`/`spiped` or terminate at your load balancer. This is a deliberate scope decision — TLS is transport-layer, not Redis protocol parity.
- **Multi-tenant isolation across databases.** `SELECT 0..15` provides Redis-style logical separation but not security separation; an attacker with `+SELECT` can move between databases. Use separate FrankenRedis processes or ACL `~prefix:*` keyspaces for hard isolation.
- **DoS via UDP / ICMP / kernel-level attacks.** That's a network-layer concern; FrankenRedis is a TCP application.

## Comparison vs alternatives

| | FrankenRedis | Redis 7.2.4 | KeyDB | Dragonfly | Microsoft Garnet | Valkey |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Language | Rust | C | C++ | C++ | C# / .NET | C |
| Memory safety | `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` | manual | manual | manual | runtime + GC | manual |
| Drop-in protocol parity goal | Redis 7.2.4 byte-exact | (oracle) | Redis fork | RESP-compatible subset | RESP-compatible subset | Redis fork |
| Threading model | single-threaded mio loop | single-threaded | multi-threaded | multi-threaded shared-nothing | multi-threaded | single-threaded |
| Differential test against canonical Redis | **yes (live diff in CI + upstream Tcl)** | n/a | no | no | no | implicit |
| First-class strict/hardened mode split | **yes** | no | no | no | no | no |
| Built-in Sentinel | **yes (`fr-sentinel`)** | yes (external binary) | yes | no (Raft built-in) | no | yes |
| Cluster sharding | not yet | yes | yes | yes | partial | yes |
| RaptorQ durability sidecar | planned (not implemented) | no | no | no | no | no |
| License | MIT | BSD-3 (≤7.2), then dual SSPLv1 / RSALv2 (7.4+) | BSD-3 | BSL 1.1 | MIT | BSD-3 (Linux Foundation Redis 7.2.4 fork) |

**Position.** FrankenRedis does not aim to be faster than Redis or to multithread it. The goal is the same observable behavior with `unsafe` removed, a real strict/hardened policy split, an explicit threat-event ledger, and a clean enough internal model that the data engine, RDB codec, replication FSM, and Lua evaluator can be embedded into other Rust projects.

---

## Limitations

Honest list of what FrankenRedis does *not* do today. The roadmap below tracks closure.

- **No multi-node cluster sharding.** The `CLUSTER` command surface is implemented for single-node mode (slot map, NODES, INFO, KEYSLOT, etc.), but FrankenRedis does not yet do CRC16 slot rebalancing or live shard migration across multiple FrankenRedis processes.
- **Wire-level TLS delegated to operational layer.** TLS configuration parsing and validation are wired through `fr-config` / `fr-runtime`, but the listener accepts plaintext only. **This is a deliberate scope decision:** TLS termination is a transport concern, not Redis protocol parity. All implemented commands behave identically over TLS or plaintext. Use `stunnel`, `spiped`, or your load balancer/reverse-proxy for TLS termination — this is the standard production pattern anyway.
- **Hash-field TTL commands (Redis 7.4) ship behind a boot-only opt-in, off by default.** The `HEXPIRE`, `HTTL`, and `HPERSIST` executors in `fr-command` are registered but gated at dispatch by `--enable-hash-field-ttl yes` / the `enable-hash-field-ttl` config directive (bead `rc-hash-ttl-contract-lhgr6`, owner decision 2026-09-05). With the default `no`, FrankenRedis matches 7.2.4 exactly: unknown-command replies, and the family is invisible to `COMMAND`/`ACL CAT` introspection. The flag is deliberately not `CONFIG SET`-able so the static introspection surfaces cannot flap at runtime. Per-field TTL storage round-trips through RDB either way so a 7.4-produced file loads.
- **Maxmemory eviction samples randomly, not into a sorted pool.** `sampled_eviction_candidate_keys` randomly samples up to `sample_limit` keys (default 5, matching upstream's `maxmemory-samples`), then picks the best LRU/LFU/TTL candidate from that sample. Upstream merges samples into a sorted `EVPOOL_SIZE = 16` pool across eviction rounds; FrankenRedis samples fresh each round.
- **RaptorQ durability sidecar is scoped and started, not yet wired to real artifacts.** The owner decision (bead `rc-raptorq-gate-d-contract-71zfo`, 2026-09-05) is IMPLEMENT: `crates/fr-fec` wraps the `raptorq` crate (RFC 6330 systematic codec) with the §19 envelope (source-hash manifest, per-symbol hashes, scrub status, decode proofs) and a passing generate/damage/scrub/recover drill; wiring the five §9 artifact classes into it is tracked in child beads.
- **The complete upstream Redis Tcl lane is evidence, not a blanket claim that every Redis test category is green.** The full external-mode workflow publishes its actual pass/skip/ignore/error counts. Separate upstream cluster, Sentinel, and module-API runners require topology/ABI-specific treatment and are not folded into the external-server count.
- **No tagged releases.** Workspace version is `0.1.0` everywhere; the project is pre-1.0 and `main` is the only branch with guarantees.

## Roadmap

1. **Multi-node cluster sharding**: CRC16 slot allocation, slot migration, MOVED/ASK redirects, gossip.
2. **A benchmark client that is not the bottleneck.** A single-core `redis-benchmark` saturates at ~75k ops/s while the server still has headroom, so `pipeline=1` `ops/s` cannot currently show a server-side win. This is a prerequisite for any further unpipelined claim.
3. ~~Multi-sentinel consensus~~ **Shipped 2026-09-03**: `is-master-down-by-addr` vote exchange and epoch leader election across peer sentinels work, quorum above one can fail over, and a three-sentinel quorum-2 automatic failover is covered by an end-to-end TCP test (bead `rc-sentinel-peer-votes`, closed).
4. **RaptorQ-everywhere sidecar** for self-healing durability of long-lived state snapshots, fixture bundles, and reproducibility ledgers. Named as a contract in `AGENTS.md`; no implementation or bead exists yet.
5. **Operator dashboard adapter** for the deployment story. (An Asupersync runtime adapter was evaluated and rejected in `docs/planning/UPGRADE_LOG.md`; the trait stubs in `fr-runtime` are empty.)

Wire-level TLS is not on this list on purpose: it was decided as a scope exclusion (bead `xzdbc`, closed WONTFIX on 2026-05-25) and stays delegated to the operational layer, as the Limitations section says.

## Developer workflow

Patterns we've found work for extending FrankenRedis without breaking parity.

### Adding a new command

1. **Find the upstream behavior first.** Read the relevant block in `legacy_redis_code/redis/src/<family>.c` and any matching `tests/unit/type/<family>.tcl`. The conformance contract is "do whatever vendored does on the same inputs, byte for byte."
2. **Add a match arm in `crates/fr-command/src/lib.rs::dispatch_argv`.** Use `eq_ascii_command(cmd, b"NEWCMD")` and parse the argv tail with the existing option-parser helpers (`parse_signed_int_arg`, `parse_f64_arg`, `parse_key_arg`, and so on).
3. **Add the corresponding `Store` method in `crates/fr-store/src/lib.rs`.** Mutators must take `now_ms: u64`, bump `modification_count`, increment the dirty counter, and trigger `capture_aof_record` from the runtime side. Read-only methods follow the `&self`-or-`&mut self`-with-`record_keyspace_lookup` pattern.
4. **Wire the AOF capture in `fr-runtime`.** If the command mutates state, add the argv to the AOF-records list before returning. If it's read-only, don't.
5. **Add fixtures in `crates/fr-conformance/fixtures/core_<family>.json`.** Each case has an `argv`, a `now_ms`, and an `ExpectedFrame`. Run the case against vendored Redis to capture the expected reply; never hand-write expectations.
6. **Add a fuzz target** if the new command has a non-trivial parser surface (`fuzz/fuzz_targets/fuzz_<family>.rs`).
7. **Run the validation suite:**

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo check  --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test   --workspace
cargo test -p fr-conformance -- --nocapture
```

### Adding a conformance fixture from observed vendored replies

The discipline for new fixtures is "never invent expectations, observe them." The canonical workflow:

1. Start vendored Redis 7.2.4 on a known port:
   ```bash
   legacy_redis_code/redis/src/redis-server --port 6390 --save "" --appendonly no
   ```
2. Run the case through `redis-cli` (or a small Rust harness) against that
   port and capture the wire reply byte-for-byte.
3. Translate the observed reply into the JSON fixture's `ExpectedFrame`
   shape (`Simple`/`Error`/`Integer`/`Bulk`/`Array`, or `SimplePattern`
   with `{hex40}` / `{int}` placeholders when the reply contains
   run-id-ish substrings).
4. Add the case to the appropriate `core_<family>.json` and re-run
   `cargo test -p fr-conformance` plus a `live_oracle_diff` against the
   same fixture to confirm the new case passes on both runtimes.

The repeating "probe sweep" workflow (described below) is the automated
form of the same loop.

### Running a probe sweep

A "probe sweep" is the workflow that drove most of Phase 11. The shape:

1. **Generate adversarial command sequences.** Empty argv, wrong arity, mid-multi nested EVAL, oversized bulks, weird option ordering, deprecated synonyms.
2. **Run each sequence against both servers** via `live_oracle_diff`.
3. **For every divergence,** open a beads issue with the argv, both replies, and the suspected root cause:

```bash
br create --type bug --priority 4 --title \
    "BLMPOP returns WRONGTYPE on non-list key (frankenredis-oks10)"
br dep add frankenredis-oks10 frankenredis-probe-sweep-N
```

4. **Close the issue with the fix.** Every commit that closes a parity bead lands with `(frankenredis-<slug>)` in the subject so `git log` traces back to the original divergence.
5. **Document the sweep** with a final `chore(beads): file follow-ups from probe sweep #N` commit listing whatever follow-ups got created from the run.

The CHANGELOG's Phase 11 section is largely the output of this workflow. The methodology is repeatable: every new sweep finds a smaller batch of remaining gaps.

### Debugging cheat-sheet

| Goal | Tool |
|---|---|
| What encoding does this key use? | `OBJECT ENCODING <key>` |
| How idle is this key? | `OBJECT IDLETIME <key>` |
| How often is this key accessed (LFU)? | `OBJECT FREQ <key>` |
| What is in this key (raw value)? | `DEBUG OBJECT <key>` (requires `enable-debug-command yes`) |
| Trace every command flowing through the server | `MONITOR` |
| What was the slowest recent command? | `SLOWLOG GET 10` |
| Where is latency budget spent? | `LATENCY HISTORY <event>` + `LATENCY DOCTOR` |
| What's the actual replication state? | `INFO replication` |
| What's the actual memory pressure? | `INFO memory` and `MEMORY STATS` |
| Force a synchronous save? | `SAVE` (blocks the loop) or `BGSAVE` (forks a child) |
| Reload the AOF without restarting? | `DEBUG LOADAOF` (requires `enable-debug-command yes`) |
| Run a single fixture case against both runtimes | `cargo run -p fr-conformance --bin live_oracle_diff -- --case <case_name> command <fixture.json> 127.0.0.1 6390` |
| Re-verify a probe-sweep hunch | `cargo run -p fr-conformance --bin adversarial_triage -- --manifest <path>` (see `--help`) |

### What runs in CI

`.github/workflows/live-conformance-gates.yml` is the main fast conformance workflow. It pins the behavioral oracle to the exact Redis 7.2.4 release SHA, builds that source, and drives formatting/lints/workspace tests, the broad live-oracle `parity` matrix, the 72-assertion upstream Tcl hard gate, protocol/Lua/bead parity probes, coverage/flake budgets, adversarial triage, schema gates, benchmark gating when requested, and failure-forensics artifacts.

An honest note on history: until 2026-09-03 neither workflow had ever completed a run. The conformance workflow failed at `cargo fmt --check` from March 2026 and then at YAML parse time from 2026-08-19; the full upstream Tcl workflow invoked `runtest` from the wrong directory on every run since it was created. Both defects were fixed in commit `780b5aa09`; the Actions tab shows the state since then, and the local equivalents (`parity_suite.py`, `upstream_redis_tcl_fidelity.py`, `cargo test --workspace`) remain the evidence to run before trusting a badge.

`.github/workflows/upstream-redis-7.2.4-full.yml` is the complete upstream-test workflow. It checks out and verifies the exact Redis 7.2.4 source, builds Redis's test-support binaries, builds FrankenRedis, and then runs every default unit from Redis's own `runtest --list-tests` against FrankenRedis in external-server mode. It publishes the raw Tcl log and structured report on relevant pushes, nightly, and on manual dispatch. **Release candidates must run this workflow with `enforce=true`; see `AGENTS.md`.**

The two workflows answer different questions and neither number should be inflated into the other: the bespoke differential corpus measures FrankenRedis's explicit parity model, while the upstream Tcl lane asks Redis's own tests directly.

## Operating practices

A few patterns we've found useful for running FrankenRedis in real scenarios.

### Migrating from vendored Redis

FrankenRedis reads vendored Redis 7.2.4 RDB files unmodified, so the simplest migration is:

```bash
# 1. On the legacy host, take a fresh snapshot.
redis-cli BGSAVE
# wait for rdb_bgsave_in_progress=0 in INFO persistence

# 2. Copy dump.rdb to the new host.
scp /var/lib/redis/dump.rdb new-host:/var/lib/frankenredis/dump.rdb

# 3. Start FrankenRedis with --rdb only. RDB auto-load on startup runs
#    only when --aof is NOT passed (matching Redis: AOF takes precedence
#    over RDB at boot if both are configured, so passing --aof against an
#    empty AOF file would start the server empty).
./target/release/frankenredis --port 6379 \
    --rdb /var/lib/frankenredis/dump.rdb

# 4. If you want AOF durability going forward, enable it after startup
#    so the in-memory state from the RDB gets persisted into the new AOF
#    via the implicit BGREWRITEAOF that CONFIG SET triggers.
#
#    Note: `dir` is a PROTECTED config in Redis 7.x, so it can only be
#    set at startup via a config file (or by first enabling
#    enable-protected-configs). The clean path is to start with
#    --config redis.conf where redis.conf contains `dir /var/lib/...`.
redis-cli -p 6379 CONFIG SET appendonly yes
```

For zero-downtime cutover, run FrankenRedis as a **replica** of the legacy primary first, let it fully catch up (`INFO replication` → `master_link_status:up`, `master_last_io_seconds_ago:0`), then issue `REPLICAOF NO ONE` on the FrankenRedis side and repoint your clients. Both directions have been integration-tested.

### Running alongside vendored Redis for differential validation

The conformance harness is the supported way to run differential checks locally:

```bash
# In one terminal: start vendored Redis on a non-standard port
legacy_redis_code/redis/src/redis-server --port 6390 --save "" --appendonly no

# Then in another: run a single fixture against both runtimes and diff replies.
# Positional args after `--`: <mode> <fixture> [host] [port].
cargo run -p fr-conformance --bin live_oracle_diff -- \
    command crates/fr-conformance/fixtures/core_strings.json 127.0.0.1 6390
```

The harness reports any wire-byte differences with the case index, the argv, and the two replies side by side, which is exactly what `(frankenredis-<slug>)` commits typically reference.

### Backup and disaster recovery

The combination of AOF (`appendfsync everysec`) and periodic RDB (`save 3600 1`) gives you a 1-second loss bound on the AOF and an hour-bounded full-snapshot for fast cold restore. For DR specifically:

- The RDB CRC64 footer guarantees that a corrupted file fails to load instead of loading partially.
- The AOF manifest tracks base + history + incremental files so an interrupted `BGREWRITEAOF` doesn't lose the live AOF stream.
- Hash field TTLs round-trip through RDB, so per-field expirations survive snapshots.

### Capacity and tuning notes

- **`hz`** (default 10) controls how often the active-expire cycle runs per second. Raise it if you have many short-TTL keys; lower it on memory-constrained hosts that don't care about prompt expiry. The upstream `active-defrag-*` keys are accepted by `CONFIG SET` for parity but FrankenRedis does not yet run an active defragmentation cycle, so they have no observable effect today.
- **`repl-backlog-size`** should be at least `(peak write throughput bytes/sec × tolerable disconnect seconds)`. The default `1mb` is too small for most production workloads.
- **`client-output-buffer-limit`** for replicas should be generous; if a slow replica is killed for OBL overflow you'll see a FULLRESYNC storm next time it reconnects.
- **`maxmemory-samples`** of 5 is sufficient for `allkeys-lru`/`volatile-lru`; raise to 10 for `allkeys-lfu`/`volatile-lfu` where counter accuracy matters more.

### Choosing strict vs hardened

| You're running… | Use |
|---|---|
| Drop-in replacement for an internal Redis where clients expect byte-exact replies | `--mode strict` |
| Internet-exposed service or one accepting input from untrusted producers | `--mode hardened` and keep the ledger |
| Conformance / differential testing | `--mode strict` (never hardened, or your diff against vendored is meaningless) |
| Side-by-side staging during migration | `--mode strict` so you can confirm byte-exact parity, then switch to hardened in production |

## FAQ

### Is FrankenRedis production-ready?

No. The workspace is `0.1.0` and there are no tagged releases. The implemented surface is exercised by a 5,076-case bespoke differential corpus, pinned live Redis 7.2.4 oracle gates, Redis 7.2.4's own upstream Tcl tests, and 33 fuzz targets, but the complete upstream external-mode report must still be read as evidence rather than a blanket compatibility certificate. In particular, multi-node sharding does not exist yet, wire TLS is delegated to the operational layer, and separate upstream cluster/Sentinel/module-API test runners require their own topology/ABI-specific treatment.

### Does it speak the regular Redis protocol?

Yes. RESP2 is native. RESP3 inbound parsing is supported, and RESP3 `Map`/`Set` replies are emitted for the appropriate commands when the client negotiates `HELLO 3`. Any client that talks to Redis 7.2.4 talks to FrankenRedis.

### Will my Lua script work?

If it works on Redis 7.2.4, very likely yes. The custom Lua 5.1 evaluator implements `redis.call`/`pcall`/`status_reply`/`error_reply`/`sha1hex`/`log`/`replicate_commands`/`set_repl`/`setresp`/`acl_check_cmd`/`breakpoint`/`debug`, the full pattern matcher including `%b`/`%f`/`%1`–`%9` back-references, the script-relevant metamethod family (`__index`/`__newindex`/`__call`/`__concat`/`__add` family/`__eq`/`__lt`/`__le`/`__tostring`/`__unm`/`__metatable`), the LuaJIT-compatible `bit` library, `cjson.encode`/`decode` with upstream `%.14g` formatting, closures with upvalue capture, and coroutines. Known gaps are `cmsgpack`, `struct`, `setfenv`/`getfenv`, `newproxy`, and the rarely-used `__mode`/`__len`/`__gc` metamethods; see Limitations.

### Can I replicate from / to vendored Redis?

Yes, both directions. The integration tests prove vendored `redis-server` → FrankenRedis replica (with and without `AUTH`) and FrankenRedis → FrankenRedis replica → downstream replica chaining.

### How does the strict/hardened mode actually differ?

Strict mode reproduces upstream behavior byte-for-byte, including upstream quirks (e.g. the `XADD LIMIT 0` wording oddity, the `CLUSTER FAILOVER` gate ordering, the exact `WRONGTYPE` phrasing). Hardened mode preserves the API contract (the same reply *shape*) but adds fail-closed guards: oversized bulks, malformed AOF tails, unknown RESP3 types, and hostile inline strings all get rejected and threat-logged instead of silently bounded-defended.

### Why is the binary called `frankenredis` and not `frankenredis-server`?

A workspace decision in `crates/fr-server/Cargo.toml`: the crate is `fr-server`, the binary is `frankenredis`. Saves typing and reads naturally next to `redis-cli`.

### Where do the names come from?

`frankenlibc` and `frankenfs` are sister projects that share the strict-vs-hardened doctrine. The "Franken-" prefix flags clean-room reimplementations whose first virtue is parity rather than novelty.

### Is there a Sentinel binary?

Yes: `frankenredis --sentinel --port 26379`. It monitors what you register with `SENTINEL MONITOR`, probes masters and replicas, and performs failovers on its own (an end-to-end test kills a primary and watches the sentinel promote the replica with no help from the test client). It exchanges `is-master-down-by-addr` votes and elects epoch leaders with peer sentinels, so quorum above 1 works, including a three-sentinel quorum-2 automatic failover covered by a TCP integration test (bead `rc-sentinel-peer-votes`). It does not yet read a `sentinel.conf` — configure it over the `SENTINEL` command surface.

### How is performance trending?

Measured against vendored Redis 7.2.4 running side-by-side in the same invocation, with `redis-benchmark` driving both engines on verified-idle cores, arm order alternated per round, median of per-round ratios, and an A/A null control in the same invocation (nulls 0.979–0.999): **`pipeline=16` throughput leads Redis — 1.46× on TTL-bearing SET, 1.33× on SET, 1.26× on INCR, 1.03× on GET** — with **1.3–2.8× fewer user-mode instructions per operation on every workload measured**, and less CPU per operation on all eight. Unpipelined throughput is within ~1.5%, pinned by a client ceiling rather than by the server. The current `XADD MAXLEN ~` rows are **1.668×** without `LIMIT` and **1.733×** with `LIMIT 100`. Each optimization round produces an `ISOMORPHISM_PROOF_*.md` artifact next to before/after flamegraphs under `artifacts/optimization/` so nothing changes observable behavior to gain a few microseconds.

### Where does the parity bar come from?

Redis 7.2.4 itself. The pinned source tree is used in two complementary ways: as a live behavioral oracle for FrankenRedis's bespoke differential suites, and as the source of the unmodified upstream Tcl tests run directly against FrankenRedis through Redis's external-server harness. The complete upstream workflow verifies the exact 7.2.4 release SHA before running. When you see `(frankenredis-<slug>)` in a commit message, that's a beads issue ID, usually filed by a differential probe sweep that found a divergence against this oracle.

### What does the `CHANGELOG.md` look like?

Organized by date-bounded development phases (Phase 1–15 plus the 2026-08-18/19 repo-janitor docs reorganization) from foundation through current state, with thematic capability sections, live-linked representative commits, and a version timeline table. There are no tagged releases; the changelog is the version spine.

## References and prior art

Pointers to the literature and to related projects whose decisions FrankenRedis either inherits, contrasts with, or learned from.

### Redis itself

- **Redis source tree.** [`redis/redis`](https://github.com/redis/redis). Redis 7.2.4 is the pinned compatibility target and behavioral oracle. Its own Tcl tests are also executed directly against FrankenRedis through upstream's external-server harness.
- **Redis Streams design note.** Antirez (Salvatore Sanfilippo), *"Streams: A new general purpose data structure in Redis"* (2017). The radix-tree-of-listpacks layout and the consumer-group model originated here.
- **Salvatore Sanfilippo, *"Redis Latency Diagnosis"*.** The documented methodology that informs the `LATENCY` / `SLOWLOG` surface and the latency-monitor budget.

### Algorithms

- **Skiplist.** William Pugh, *"Skip Lists: A Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Trees"* (CACM 1990). FrankenRedis uses a `BTreeMap` instead, but the observable contract (`O(log n)` ordered access, by-rank lookup, by-range scan) is the same.
- **HyperLogLog.** Flajolet, Fusy, Gandouet, Meunier, *"HyperLogLog: the analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm"* (2007); plus Heule, Nunkesser, Hall, *"HyperLogLog in Practice"* (2013) for the small-cardinality bias correction and the sparse representation.
- **Geohash.** G. M. Morton, *"A computer-oriented geodetic data base and a new technique in file sequencing"* (IBM 1966); the Z-order curve / bit-interleaving idea Redis applies to spatial indexing.
- **CRC64.** Jones polynomial as adapted in `redis/src/crc64.c`; the Reed-Solomon-style polynomial-arithmetic background is covered in Koopman & Chakravarty, *"32-Bit Cyclic Redundancy Codes for Internet Applications"* (DSN 2002).
- **LZF compression.** Marc Lehmann's pure-stream variant (LibLZF). The format predates LZ4 and is what RDB uses on disk.
- **RaptorQ.** RFC 6330, *"RaptorQ Forward Error Correction Scheme for Object Delivery"* (Luby et al., 2011). Roadmap item for the durability sidecar.

### Comparable clean-room reimplementations

- **KeyDB.** Multithreaded Redis fork in C++. Solved scale-up via per-shard threads; FrankenRedis keeps the single-threaded model and goes after memory safety + parity instead.
- **Dragonfly.** C++ shared-nothing multi-threaded Redis-compatible. Re-architected the data layer for multi-core throughput; not a parity project.
- **Microsoft Garnet.** .NET RESP-compatible server with very high throughput. Different language / runtime trade-offs.
- **Valkey.** Linux Foundation Redis fork. Closest to upstream by lineage; FrankenRedis differs by being a clean-room rewrite in Rust.
- **TiKV / FoundationDB.** Distributed KV stores, *not* Redis-compatible. Cited here because they are the canonical examples of "Rust / C++ memory-safe rewrites of a database protocol" and inform some of the testing-discipline choices (differential testing, deterministic simulation, lineage marker artifacts).

### Doctrine

- **`frankenlibc` / `frankenfs`.** Sibling projects in this author's portfolio that share the strict/hardened mode split and the threat-event ledger pattern.
- **`beads_rust` (`br`).** Local-first issue tracker used for parity bookkeeping. Every `(frankenredis-<slug>)` commit tag references a tracked beads issue.
- **Differential testing.** Yang et al., *"Finding and Understanding Bugs in C Compilers"* (PLDI 2011, *Csmith*), the canonical reference for differential testing as a methodology. The FrankenRedis probe-sweep workflow is the same idea applied to a stateful protocol server.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **AOF** | Append-Only File. A RESP-encoded log of every write command, replayed on startup to reconstruct the in-memory store. |
| **beads** | Local-first issue tracker (the `br` CLI from [`beads_rust`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust)) used to file and track parity gaps. Tags like `(frankenredis-xyz)` in commits reference beads issue IDs. |
| **BGSAVE / BGREWRITEAOF** | Background snapshot / AOF rewrite, executed in a forked child process so the live server keeps serving traffic during the rewrite. |
| **CRC64** | The 64-bit cyclic-redundancy-check polynomial Redis uses to fingerprint RDB files and `DUMP`/`RESTORE` payloads. Uses the Redis-specific polynomial. |
| **DLRC** | Deterministic Latency Replication Core. The project's tagline for "strict command semantics + tail-aware scheduling + recoverable persistence." |
| **DUMP / RESTORE** | Single-key serialization commands. `DUMP` returns the RDB-encoded value + CRC64; `RESTORE` injects it into another instance. The on-wire format is byte-compatible with vendored Redis 7.2.4. |
| **embstr** | "Embedded string": a Redis encoding for strings ≤44 bytes where the SDS header lives in the same allocation as the object header. FrankenRedis reports this via `OBJECT ENCODING`. |
| **FCALL / FCALL_RO** | Function call. Invokes a function loaded by `FUNCTION LOAD`. The read-only variant rejects writes. |
| **FrankenRedis modes** | `Mode::Strict` (byte-exact upstream parity) or `Mode::Hardened` (preserves contract, adds fail-closed guards). Set via `--mode`. |
| **FULLRESYNC** | The PSYNC response that triggers a full snapshot stream from primary to replica when partial resync isn't possible. |
| **HdrHistogram** | "High dynamic range histogram": a fixed-memory data structure with bounded relative precision used to record latency distributions. |
| **intset** | Redis encoding for sets containing only integers. Stored as a sorted array of fixed-width integers. |
| **listpack** | Redis 7.x replacement for ziplist. A compact, immutable-on-mutation sequential layout used for small hashes, sets, sorted sets, and stream entries. |
| **LZF** | Marc Lehmann's lightweight compression algorithm; used by Redis (and FrankenRedis) for RDB string compression. |
| **mio** | `mio` is the Rust non-blocking I/O abstraction over `epoll`/`kqueue`. fr-server's event loop is built on it. |
| **PSYNC** | Replication handshake command that asks for partial sync if `(repl_id, offset)` is in the primary's backlog window, falling back to FULLRESYNC otherwise. |
| **quicklist** | Redis list encoding: a doubly-linked list of listpack nodes. The compromise between linked-list flexibility and contiguous-memory cache friendliness. |
| **RaptorQ** | A systematic fountain code (RFC 6330) for forward error correction; named in AGENTS.md as the planned mechanism for durability sidecars on long-lived artifacts. Not yet implemented. |
| **RDB** | Redis Database. A binary point-in-time snapshot of the keyspace. FrankenRedis emits RDB version 11. |
| **RESP / RESP2 / RESP3** | REdis Serialization Protocol. RESP2 is the legacy line/bulk/array/integer/error protocol; RESP3 adds map/set/double/bool/null/big-number types. Negotiated via `HELLO`. |
| **S_DOWN / O_DOWN** | Sentinel subjective-down / objective-down. Subjective = "this Sentinel hasn't heard from the instance in `down-after-milliseconds`"; objective = "at least `quorum` Sentinels agree." |
| **SDS** | Simple Dynamic String. Redis's string type. FrankenRedis stores the equivalent as `Vec<u8>` with promotion metadata on the wrapping `Entry`. |
| **skiplist** | Probabilistic ordered data structure Redis uses for the ordered side of large sorted sets. FrankenRedis uses a `BTreeMap` instead with equivalent observable complexity. |
| **threat class** | One of eight categories in `fr-config::ThreatClass` describing what kind of misbehavior a request represents. Drives the policy decision in hardened mode. |
| **upstream Tcl lane** | Redis 7.2.4's own unmodified default `runtest` suite executed against FrankenRedis through upstream's external-server mode. |
| **vendored Redis** | The pinned Redis 7.2.4 source/binary used as the canonical live behavioral oracle by the conformance harness. |
| **ziplist** | Legacy Redis compact encoding for small collections. Replaced by listpack in Redis 7.x and not emitted by FrankenRedis. |

## About Contributions

Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.
