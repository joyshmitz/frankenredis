//! Packed string-set encoding — the succinct, listpack-style representation for
//! SMALL generic (non-integer) sets that sit behind `OBJECT ENCODING listpack`.
//!
//! fr currently stores such sets in an `IndexSet<Vec<u8>>`: one heap block plus a
//! hash-table slot *per member*. Redis instead packs a small set into a single
//! contiguous listpack buffer (one allocation, cache-friendly linear scan), only
//! promoting to a hash table at the `set-max-listpack-entries` / `-value`
//! threshold. fr already does the integer case (`SetValue::Int` = sorted
//! `Vec<i64>`); this is the string analogue (frankenredis-9mh3o).
//!
//! STEP 1 (this file): the primitive + an `IndexSet`-equivalence proof. Wiring it
//! into `SetValue` (SADD/SREM/SISMEMBER/SMEMBERS/…) is a mechanical follow-up to
//! be done when fr-store is not being concurrently edited. Behaviour is identical
//! to an insertion-ordered `IndexSet`: dedup on insert, iteration in insertion
//! order, removal preserves the order of the survivors — so SMEMBERS/SSCAN/SPOP
//! output is byte-for-byte unchanged.

// ── OBJECT ENCODING listpack/quicklist tracking (frankenredis-rc49s) ──
//
// Redis decides the listpack→quicklist transition at ADD time, not at query
// time: `listTypeTryConvertListpack` (t_list.c) converts when
// `quicklistNodeExceedsLimit(fill, lpBytes(existing) + sum(sdslen(added)),
// count)` — the newly-pushed elements are counted by their RAW byte length,
// while the existing listpack contributes its real encoded `lpBytes`. The
// result is therefore construction-order dependent and sticky, and CANNOT be
// reproduced by a stateless re-encode of the final contents (fr's old
// `list_fits_legacy_listpack_size` over-counted the last element by
// `encoded_len - raw_len`, flipping ~±1 element early/late at the 8 KiB
// boundary). We mirror the real semantics by tracking, incrementally, the
// exact `lpBytes` of the list and the sticky decision under the DEFAULT byte
// budget (`list-max-listpack-size = -2` ⇒ 8192; the only value for which
// `forced_quicklist` is consulted — other budgets fall back to the stateless
// estimate in `Store::object_encoding`).
