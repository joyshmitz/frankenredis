//! `KeyDict` — a redis-dict-class chaining hash table in 100% safe Rust.
//! (frankenredis-uhthd) **This IS `Store::entries`.**
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! fr's keyspace was a `hashbrown::HashMap<Box<[u8]>, Entry>`. hashbrown is
//! open-addressing, which gives compact storage but provides **neither** of the
//! two capabilities a Redis keyspace needs natively:
//!
//!   1. a **resumable cursor SCAN** that tolerates concurrent rehash, and
//!   2. **O(1) uniform-ish random sampling** (RANDOMKEY / eviction).
//!
//! So fr bolts on side indices — `ordered_keys: BTreeSet<Arc<[u8]>>` (SCAN/KEYS)
//! and `random_key_slots: Vec<Vec<Arc<[u8]>>>` (RANDOMKEY) — each of which keeps
//! a *second* `Arc<[u8]>` copy of every key plus its own structure overhead.
//! That redundancy is the bulk of the keyspace's ~4.5x RAM vs Redis.
//!
//! Redis avoids it with a **chaining** dict: every key lives in exactly one
//! bucket (`hash & mask`), so (a) a deletion never moves another key — slot
//! positions are stable — which lets the **reverse-binary cursor** of
//! `dictScan` walk buckets without missing any key that is present for the whole
//! scan, even across a table doubling; and (b) RANDOMKEY just picks a random
//! bucket. This module reimplements that, owning each key once as a `Box<[u8]>`
//! (no refcount header, no `Arc` sharing), so that when it replaces `entries` it
//! also deletes `ordered_keys` + `random_key_slots` wholesale.
//!
//! ## Status: WIRED
//!
//! `Store::entries` is a `KeyDict`. Keyspace SCAN runs through [`KeyDict::scan`]
//! and RANDOMKEY through [`KeyDict::random_sample`], and `ordered_keys`,
//! `random_key_slots` and the two SCAN resume caches are deleted. Measured against
//! a live Redis 7.2.4 in one invocation, 1M keys, A/A null 0.9995:
//! **248.1 -> 145.4 bytes/key, 3.0005x -> 1.7612x.**
//!
//! Grows at load factor 1 and shrinks under ~10% fill
//! ([`maybe_shrink`](KeyDict::maybe_shrink), Redis's HASHTABLE_MIN_FILL policy) so a
//! keyspace that spikes large then sheds its keys returns the bucket memory — the
//! reverse-binary cursor keeps its no-missed-key guarantee across both grow and
//! shrink (verified by the scan-across-growth and scan-across-shrink tests).
//!
//! `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` holds: chaining uses arena indices, not raw links.

/// 110.4 B/key resident against 91.7 accounted and shows NO retained block, which is
/// how this lever was very nearly sized at -3.2 B/key and dropped as marginal. The
/// reason is that `#[global_allocator]` lives in `fr-server/src/main.rs` alone, so
/// the fr-store TEST binary runs on system malloc, which munmaps a large free
/// immediately, while the shipping server runs mimalloc, which does not. The
/// instrument is measuring a different allocator from the one that ships, and is
/// blind to every retention effect by construction.
///
/// Chunking removes the growth copy rather than hiding it: a slot index is
/// `(chunk, offset)` by construction, so growth never moves a live node and never
/// touches a byte of one. That also makes the arena index STABLE, which the bucket
/// heads and `next` links already depend on, and it takes an O(n) memcpy off the
/// insert path that crosses a power of two.
///
/// The trade is one extra load per node access -- `chunks[i >> SHIFT][i & MASK]`
/// instead of `nodes[i]` -- and it is NOT free. Measured under callgrind on a fixed
/// 20k-key populate plus 20,000 GETs, two runs per arm, the same job on both
