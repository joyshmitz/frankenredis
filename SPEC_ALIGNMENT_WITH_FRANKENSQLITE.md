# SPEC_ALIGNMENT_WITH_FRANKENSQLITE

This project now carries a local exemplar copy:

- `COMPREHENSIVE_SPEC_FOR_FRANKENSQLITE_V1_REFERENCE.md`

## Alignment Rules

1. Preserve spec-first workflow with explicit phase gates and evidence artifacts.
2. Keep strict/hardened mode split as a first-class compatibility-security contract.
3. Attach performance changes to profile-first loops and isomorphism proofs.
4. Treat durability evidence as first-class output artifacts with sidecar planning.
5. Track parity in a machine-readable matrix (`FEATURE_PARITY.md`) with severity taxonomy.
6. Enforce full drop-in feature/functionality overlap as non-negotiable end-state; no permanent scope reduction.

## Current FrankenRedis Adoption Status

- Adopted: phase-gated porting docs, conformance fixture harness, baseline/perf artifacts, strict-mode gate scaffolding.
- In progress: replication/persistence deep parity, RaptorQ sidecar generation, operator dashboard integration.
- Pending: full 100% command-family coverage and release-grade drift gates.
